@VirginAmerica it's really aggressive to blast obnoxious ""entertainment"" in your guests' faces &amp; they have little recourse
@VirginAmerica and it's a really big bad thing about it
@VirginAmerica seriously would pay $30 a flight for seats that didn't have this playing.
it's really the only bad thing about flying VA
@VirginAmerica  I flew from NYC to SFO last week and couldn't fully sit in my seat due to two large gentleman on either side of me. HELP!
@VirginAmerica you guys messed up my seating.. I reserved seating with my friends and you guys gave my seat away ...  I want free internet
@VirginAmerica status match program.  I applied and it's been three weeks.  Called and emailed with no response.
@VirginAmerica What happened 2 ur vegan food options?! At least say on ur site so i know I won't be able 2 eat anything for next 6 hrs #fail

@VirginAmerica Your chat support is not working on your site: http://t.co/vhp2GtDWPk

@VirginAmerica heyyyy guyyyys.. been trying to get through for an hour. can someone call me please? :/
@VirginAmerica Hi, Virgin! I'm on hold for 40-50 minutes -- are there any earlier flights from LA to NYC tonight; earlier than 11:50pm?
@VirginAmerica everything was fine until you lost my bag
@VirginAmerica your airline is awesome but your lax loft needs to step up its game. $40 for dirty tables and floors? http://t.co/hy0VrfhjHt
@VirginAmerica what is going on with customer service? Is there anyway to speak to a human asap? Thank you.
@VirginAmerica why can't you supp the biz traveler like @SouthwestAir  and have customer service like @JetBlue #neverflyvirginforbusiness
@VirginAmerica I have no interesting flying with you after this. I will Cancelled Flight my next four flights I planned.#neverflyvirginforbusiness
@VirginAmerica it was a disappointing experience which will be shared with every business traveler I meet. #neverflyvirgin
@VirginAmerica I’m having trouble adding this flight my wife booked to my Elevate account. Help? http://t.co/pX8hQOKS3R
@VirginAmerica Why is the site down?  When will it be back up?
@VirginAmerica I like the TV and interesting video . Just disappointed in Cancelled Flightled flight when other flights went out to jfk on Saturday .
@VirginAmerica just landed in LAX, an hour after I should of been here. Your no Late Flight bag check is not business travel friendly #nomorevirgin
@VirginAmerica Is it me, or is your website down?  BTW, your new website isn't a great user experience.  Time for another redesign.
@VirginAmerica I can't check in or add a bag. Your website isn't working. I've tried both desktop and mobile http://t.co/AvyqdMpi1Y
@VirginAmerica - Let 2 scanned in passengers leave the plane than told someone to remove their bag from 1st class bin? #uncomfortable
@virginamerica What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
@VirginAmerica is anyone doing anything there today?  Website is useless and no one is answering the phone.
@VirginAmerica why must a traveler miss a flight to Late Flight check a bag?  I missed my morning appointments and you lost my business. #sfo2lax
@VirginAmerica your no Late Flight bag check just lost you my business. I missed flight and AM apt. Three other people on flight had same exp.
@VirginAmerica called your service line and was hung up on. This is awesome. #sarcasm
@VirginAmerica your site is tripping. I'm trying to check in and I'm getting the plain text version. I am reluctant to enter any card info.
@VirginAmerica should I be concerned that I am about to fly on a plane that needs to be delayed due to a ""tech stop""?
@VirginAmerica And now the flight Flight Booking Problems site is totally down. Folks, what is the problem?
@VirginAmerica I like the customer service but a 40 min delay just for connecting passengers seems too long. VA370
@VirginAmerica you are failing your customers because your check in process does not link to TSA pre-check.
@VirginAmerica @FiDiFamilies us too! Terrible airline! Just gave us a hotel hotline number and said sorry
@VirginAmerica @ChrysiChrysic your assistance yesterday when u Cancelled Flightled our flight was to give us a hotel hotline  Shame on you!
@VirginAmerica Another delayed flight? #likingyoulessandless
@VirginAmerica I need to register a service dog for a first class ticket from SFO &gt; Dulles. The phone queue is an hour or longer. Pls advise
@VirginAmerica why can't we book seats on your flights when we buy them or even during check in? Creates so much anxiety! #frustrated
@VirginAmerica I paid the premium to fly you across the country, you Cancelled Flight my flight and offer no check fee or upgrade love? Sad face :(
.@VirginAmerica I don't understand why you need a DM to give me an answer on if you have a damaged luggage policy.
.@VirginAmerica does that mean you don't have a policy for destroyed luggage?
@VirginAmerica having problems Flight Booking Problems on the web site. keeps giving me an error and to contact by phone.  phone is 30 minute wait.
@VirginAmerica I rang, but there is a wait for 35 minutes!! I can book the same ticket through a vendor, fix your site
@VirginAmerica got a flight (we were told) for 4:50 today..,checked my email and its for 4;50 TOMORROW. This is unacceptable.
@VirginAmerica our flight into lga was Cancelled Flighted. We're stuck in Dallas. I called to reschedule, told I could get a flight for today...(1/2)
@virginamerica why don't any of the pairings include red wine?! Only white is offered :( #redwineisbetter
@VirginAmerica I'm disappointed that the agent at the designated silver status check in line @Dulles_Airport closed to assist all pasengers
@VirginAmerica Is it normal to receive no reply from Central Baggage #baggageissues #smh
@VirginAmerica at Logan airport and waiting to checkin for my 9am flight. Checkin desk not open !!!!! Why?!
@VirginAmerica congrats, you just got all my business from EWR to SFO/LAX. Fuck you @united fl1289 SFO/EWR was the clincher...
@VirginAmerica  I applied over 2 weeks ago. Haven't heard back and I'm flying this week #disappointed
@VirginAmerica - too many apologies! You r the worse airlines! Don't even respond to your cudtomers
@VirginAmerica shame on VA for making people spend money in stranded cities when other airlines are landing at JFK! Who will reimburse me?
@VirginAmerica too bad you say it takes 10 to 14 days via YOUR confirmation email. When I inquired after 3 weeks you claim 6 to 8 weeks!
@VirginAmerica a lot of ""apologies"" being thrown out to customers from what I can see.Very sad. Thanks for nothing. Worst airline ever.
@VirginAmerica  for all my flight stuff wrong and did nothing about it. Had #worst #flight ever
@VirginAmerica trying to book a flight with you guys and your website won't let me... about to lose my business
@VirginAmerica you suck!
@VirginAmerica Just DM'd. Same issue persisting.
@VirginAmerica Because we never rec'd Cancelled Flightlation notice we were left w no options to fly out of PS. Driving to LA for a red eye Mon w kids
@VirginAmerica trying to book a flight &amp; your site is down 
@VirginAmerica you stink. Flight Cancelled Flighted from PSP to JFK and no notification or ability to rebook #disappointed.  #expected better
@VirginAmerica Your website is down and I'm trying to check in!
@VirginAmerica flight 404 delayed 2 hours in LA due to mechanical problems. Handle like pros but you could have tossed us a free drink.
@VirginAmerica You guys charged me $100 to reschedule a flight that was then Cancelled Flighted and are now refusing to refund it. What's the deal?
@VirginAmerica can’t access your website from Safari on iPhone 6. Seems to work on Mac and iPad. Need iPhone to add Passbook.
@VirginAmerica why Cancelled Flight flight VX413? One sec its delayed, on my to airport, the next its Cancelled Flightled?Gonna email or call me to reschedule?
@VirginAmerica I did it but there was a problem in the link from the email for check-in. thanks
@VirginAmerica had to change to another airline to get to DC today ... Why is @united able to land in DC but not you? Cost me $800 ...ugh
@VirginAmerica I was so looking forward to my first flight with you today but it was Cancelled Flightled along with the subsequent one ...
@VirginAmerica  how are you gonna have a deal from Dallas to DC but no deal from DC to Dallas? #sad
@VirginAmerica hold times at call center are a bit much
@VirginAmerica the CSS on your site is a 404 right now, please fix. Site unusable.
@VirginAmerica current bug on website shows ‘select departure city’ when selecting destination city http://t.co/SLLYIBE2vQ
@VirginAmerica luggage was severely dented/missing wheel coming off baggage claim in SAN. Luggage agent Miranda (I think) wasn't any help.
@VirginAmerica requested window seat and confirmed window but got stuck in middle seat. Not a good way to treat silver member
@VirginAmerica there is something wrong with you website in Safari iPhone
@VirginAmerica Boo for a not refunding a seat upgrade fee I did not want to buy in the first place!
@VirginAmerica moved my seat with no notice. ""Better seat"" is cabin select not behind the row I selected #DISAPPOINTED
@VirginAmerica already contacted Central Baggage &amp; sent DM. @RenttheRunway is charging me for the dress that was in the lost suitcase #help
@VirginAmerica @VirginAtlantic I have just checked in flight to SFO from LAX &amp; been told as Atlantic Flying Club Gold I get no benefits?!
@VirginAmerica husband and I ordered three drinks via my screen and they never came. Awesome!
@VirginAmerica soooo are you guys going to leave the seatbelt light on all flight? You can barely call this turbulence :-)
@VirginAmerica Funny story, your website is broken, you have missing javascript and stylesheets on the checkin process. I dislike this!
@VirginAmerica I'm trying to check into my 10:50AM CT flight tmm on the desktop website and it's not working (some sort of caching bug) SOS
@VirginAmerica Do you guys know your check-in links from emails are broken? http://t.co/2npXB6oBMr
@VirginAmerica lost my luggage 4 days ago on flight VX 112 from LAX to IAD &amp; I'm calling every day, no response.Please give me back my stuff
@virginamerica Looks like a broken link for your assets https://t.co/OArDjjGrrD
@virginamerica the manage itinerary section of your website seems to be broken for me https://t.co/2pUJvCElNg
@VirginAmerica can't check in, your site looks like this every time it loads http://t.co/kAcY2AwDbW
@virginAmerica Other carriers are less than half price for a round trip fare. I am stunned. http://t.co/UKdjjijroW
@VirginAmerica WTF is happening in PDX Late Flight March such that one way from SFO is ~$550?
@VirginAmerica my luggage is gone. I've filed my paperwork, promised a call/email. Still no resolution or response from central luggage.
@VirginAmerica I requested a mileage challenge for status several weeks ago online but haven't heard back. How do I get help with this?
@VirginAmerica Applied for Status Match on Feb 1. Got confirmation email same day. Still no news though. You guys have dropped ball Late Flightly 
@virginamerica not really the experience I was hoping 4, I ws forced 2 check in a small carry on, w/ nothing but empty cabin space on board
@VirginAmerica I spoke with a representative that offered no solution, I am a loyal customer who flies on @VirginAtlantic as well
@VirginAmerica I am deeply disappointed that your birthday promo was not applied to a trip I booked mere days before I received the email
@VirginAmerica on VX399 from JFK to LA - dirty plane - not up to your standards.
@VirginAmerica on flight VX399 headed to LA from JFK - dirtiest VA plane I have ever been on. Sad for a great airline.
@VirginAmerica your Avis rental continue button doesn't work on your website to book car. Tried 4 times on phone.  This sucks!
@VirginAmerica delayed to10.30!!
@VirginAmerica currently in minute 10 of being on hold with cust. service. Do I need to do anything to add a lap child to my reservation?
@VirginAmerica Comenity Bank is a joke!  Please change.  Nothing but constant problems with this bank
@VirginAmerica, I submitted a status match request a while back and still haven’t heard! I’m flying on Monday. Can you look / accelerate?
@VirginAmerica I cannot even open my laptop in seat 4C and I paid a premium for this?!!   Let me out of here!
@VirginAmerica I am in seat 4C and I cannot even open my laptop; and I paid extra for this seat!!
@VirginAmerica Status match - 2 weeks have gone by and no news.Flt next week - hope flt will count towards requirement.  Cust Svc no help!!!
@VirginAmerica how come you don't have an iPhone app? Still using and making me waste paper.
@VirginAmerica Your back of seat entertainment system does not accept credit cards that  have an apostrophe in the surname. #apostrophefail
@VirginAmerica kinda sucked my earphone jack didn't work on my flight. They may want to look into that for future passengers
@VirginAmerica Very poor experience. First computer problem now seat malfunction. Stuck. Missing meeting in San Diego.
@VirginAmerica I tried that. You offered to charge me an additional $1k for a new ticket or be stranded until Thurs. 1st time, last time.
@VirginAmerica Never had a bad experience before, but this one took the cake. Now extortion for carry on items as well?
@VirginAmerica Had to spend 5 hours worrying that items in carryon would be broken/stolen since I couldn't carry them on plane or lock bag.
@VirginAmerica All of group E was told there was no more room in the bins. when I got on the plane, was room for at least 4 bags in my row!
@VirginAmerica I have lots of flights to book and your site it not working!!!! I've been on the phone waiting for over 10 minutes..........
@VirginAmerica Why is it taking 12 years to fly home to Dallas? Get your shit together.
@VirginAmerica Man of steel flies to more cities though...and with more frequency too.
@VirginAmerica started my flight with a scolding for using an overhead bin that was then offered to the person seated next to me.
@VirginAmerica While other airlines weren't Cancelled Flighting flights into BOS, and helping their customers get home, Virgin was saying Good luck!
@VirginAmerica Grouping Virgin in with the others now. BOS weather has exposed their actual Cus Serv model. Never Flight Booking Problems with Virgin again!
@VirginAmerica As one of the travelers affected by the Boston storm, I'm shocked at Virgin's complete apathy toward their customers.
@VirginAmerica my group got their Cancelled Flightlation fees waived but I can't because my ticket is booked for 2/18? Your reps were no help either 
@united still no refund or word via DM. Please resolve this issue as your Cancelled Flightled flight was useless to my assistant's trip.
@united Delayed due to lack of crew and now delayed again because there's a long line for deicing... Still need to improve service #united
@united is the worst. Nonrefundable First class tickets? Oh because when you select Global/FC their system auto selects economy w/upgrade.
@united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service
@united if the car seat is lost @united should just reimburse me for a new one, this is not a pair of shoes, it's a necessity for my child
@united beginning of Feb I called United they said they would send another voucher by mail. Never got anything. #tiredofwaiting
@United the internet is a great thing.  I am emailing executives in your company, maybe they will respond to me in a timely manner.
@united thats weak. See ya 
Hey @VirginAmerica !!
@united I flew back w other company since United didnt have an earlier flight
@united I am trying to book awards for September and need flights on @aegeanairlines but they will not show even w/ many award seats availab
@united I sure did.   I had to drive a total of 3 hours to get my own bag.  I'd like to explain that debacle but no one wants to talk to me.
@united See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr.  After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue.
@united why no preferred security line anymore. My TSA pre-check didn't pull on my @SilverAirways partner flight! #Platinum #spoiled
@united How does United refuse to reissue a $400 lost voucher when their plane didn't take off due to mechanics? #badcustomerservice
@united yes, we've been with the agents for the last 50 minutes. One of the agents have been very rude, but thankfully Ladan has been nice.
@united iah to charlotte. Baggage claim rep latrice h. #customerservice non existent, Ignored customer then inappropriately touched customer
@united @UCtraveladvisor - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad
@united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient
@united then why have I not received my call back its been 3 days...it's an infant car seat how am I supposed to go anywhere with my child
@United well sitting on the ground 'on time' but waiting for a gate....again #tiredofthis
@united No, I need you guys to not over book planes. It's not a concern, I'll just travel with someone else moving forward.
@united A measly $50 e-certificate is not how you appreciate loyal customers after they wait 3hrs on the tarmac during UA1116. #unacceptable
@united rude rude
@united - Why can't I get a boarding pass for my Austrian Airlines codeshare flight. Rebook incls a 6 hour layover &amp; I am stuck outside sec
@united just flew to #TelAviv paid $100 from a third suitcase which didn't even make it on the plane! Besides for the impolite service...
@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.
@united you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes
@united once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague. Was told ""we can't find a supervisor.""
@united ZCC82U Cancelled Flight flight 16h in advance??? Need connect flight reschedule so the link isn't helping. Help!? Gf waited months to see me.
@united I will not be flying you again
@united in addition, my first flight was delayed an hour and I'm arriving at my destination 8 hrs Late Flight.
@united v upset with your disability  ""services"". When I told one of your employees I was carrying medical equipment she was very rude.
@united thnx for quick reply but don't think you can assist. Our intl grp will be put to considerable inconvenience today.
@united wont transfer flight ticket to accompany an 11 yr old who's active military mom had to have emergency brain surgery? WOW!!
@united @getmeontop 7 WEEKS Late FlightR AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY MILES FROM THE MileagePlus Gift Card $150 STARBUCKS CARD I HANDED OVER!!!
@united not yet. I complained about the guy who checked my luggage in as he was throwing the bags around. Unfortunate coincidence I hope?
@united OKC ticket agent Roger McLarren(sp?) LESS than helpful with our Intl group travel problems Can't find a supervisor for help.
@united another fail for the United ticket agents in OKC. LESS than helpful and could care less about our problems. American here we come.
@united I just sent an email to Customer Care, telling them I may have to break up with you . I sincerely hope they can help me!!
@united silly I'm flying delta today. Your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk
@united well, you can't fix me missing my buddies 30th bday because of negligence but you can attempt to make up for it.
@united why am I to believe they will help when customer service couldn't? Like I said, I want a number to someone who can fix what you did.
@united what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn't read them? (Continued)
@united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys
@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA 236 LAS to IAD 2/24 mechanical problems again - took off - had to land for fix - delayed again #wtfodds!
@United. What's going on with UA 236?  outbound flight last thurs was delayed 4hrs How long will this delay be? #worst2unitedflightsever
@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA1429 IAD to LAS 2/19 mechanical problems - switched aircraft delayed 3.5 hours!
@united crashed trying to check in.
@united on 768 to Logan - boarding gong show due to lax carry on enforcement. Bins full of coats = no room for bags. U need a better system!
@united Blackmailed me into paying £130 extra or having my return ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam
@united disappointed that u didnt honor my $100 credit given to me for ur mistakes. Taking my business elsewhere  ✌️out.
@united ua1673 still waiting! Supposed to depart 9:08
@united ok it's now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. I gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! Terrible service
@united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice
@united What's going on with your website? I'm Flight Booking Problems three tickets today and I've been booted off the system umpteen times.
@united how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable?
@united I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one.
@united @simonroesner you'll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it's like sitting on a concrete bench.
@united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling
@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,
@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
@united Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine.
@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
@united Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought
.@united it will be because I'm moving to @AmericanAir because of @united talk, no service
@united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better.
@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused
@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.
@united $25 United coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a 9-hour flight, seriously? #Ridiculousness #learncustomerservice
@united So they didn't drop my bag overnight &amp; now I'm leaving for a week. This is why you were supposed to hold on to the bag....
@united I did DM the details but still no response. I have to book today.
@united not able to DM you my confirmation number
@united very unhappy at no response to complaint emailed on 2nd Feb ref.8441639. Awful customer service!
@united common!! keep your paper work ready and don't delay our flights(#1585)and meetings @ChooseChicago
@united I'm so frustrated and nervous because of this.
@united are the ones who make it difficult for me.
@united how does it get Cancelled Flightled 10 hours before take off?
@united This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you?
@united I'm seeking to go 2 client. B/c u cant get me there I need refund. I filled out form not confident it works if past is an indication
@united Luckily I made my flights this time but was so disappointed with the lack of communication :(
@united checking to see why flight 3466 (atl-ord) got Cancelled Flighted?
@united service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that's not an option.
@united Booked a flight home over 7 months ago and requested seats together for my fiancée and I. We got 2 middle seats. UNACCEPTABLE. The
@united YOU GUYS ARE HORRIBLE.
@united Why do I have to pay $ 17 for wifi with an international business ticket?  #pennypincher
@united ok. To top things off, you've lost my luggage. Could you get ANY worse??? #UnitedAirlines
@united AND my luggage has been broken!! #youcouldntmakethis up #brokenwheel
@united maybe one day you'll be the one quoted on http://t.co/mJkpgVXmPC
@United flight delayed-no one remembered to turn the heat on flight 559 leaving ORD-seriously???
@united to speak to a real person to get this resolved politely and efficiently. (2/2)
@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr
@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
@united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN
@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
@united has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers, does anyone know the UK customer service number for #UnitedAirlines
@united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I'd have it back yesterday!
@united just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn't be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight
@united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning???
@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room...
@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back!
@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United.
@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here.
@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
@united Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Returning home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required
@united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1.
@united yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!
@united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
@united I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail
@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
@united Thanks; might want to fix this line: ""Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days.""
@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket.
@united at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!
@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier
@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
@united good to know you will open the closed doors for ""premier passengers"" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed.
@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights.
@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B
@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away.
@united agent split up my reservation? Now can't Cancelled Flight and refund credit for 2wks? Why
@united why would they make me share a room?
@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway
@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund
@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please.
@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United
@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
@united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'
@united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like
@united flt 1249 Cancelled Flightled and I get email @3:30 AM? What happened to courtesy phn call? Had to book diff airline &amp; city
@united better train your support staff with appropriate decorum, consider revisiting your terrible ""provide a death certificate' policy
@united Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys learn?
@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!
@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable.
@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool
@united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
@united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help?
@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!
@united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks
@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?
@united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp; 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigated—my time wasted (2/2)
@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?
@united That's correct—I've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
@united http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn, however, is completely under your control—the price was and still is displayed on http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn.
@united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
@united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably.
@united Been trying since 1230 to file a report.
@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
@united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat
@united: I don't care that a @thehipmunk link showed me a ""wrong"" price on your site—it's your site &amp; responsibility to ensure correctness.
“@united: @mllovelace The baggage fee is waived for Premier members. Please see http://t.co/u6Duw27mDE. ^JP” what's the point of membership?
@united wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime
@united 3 days Late Flightr and my bag has not left IAD, United is not helping at all. Everyone tells me a different story
@United how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh.
@united caught earlier flight to ORD. Gate checked bag, and you've lost it at O'Hare. original flight lands in 20minutes. #frustrating!
@united Can you please follow for a Dm on a missing bag?
@united i left an item on the plane and have been calling non stop and no one has been answering can you please help
@united what's a good number to call to speak with someone about how you can fix what you did to 50 people and their luggage on Saturday?
@united where's my damn bag??
@united well someone should tell that to the employees at the Denver baggage claim. Still no bag!!!!
@united diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it's way to MSY. If you only had people that cared
@united Male agnt in LAS threatens Canadian cust when cust takes pic of him at gate after agents announce can't help rebook. #friendlyskies?
@united @Apollochplayers we just want to go home tonight - why did you Cancelled Flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #PH6RPS
@united  Stressed and rude agents. Overwhelmed by delyd flight LAS-DEN 1657. Yelling at several people. Not pretty. This is #friendlyskies??
@united FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS
@united has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH.
@United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother
@united the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That's how @Delta would handle.
@united your customer service is terrible! Stood inline 3 hours no flights and 4 hours Late Flightr still no bag#disgutedindenver
@united boarding time shows 35 min and your gate agent started at 45. showed up at 4:00 and they had to check bag. http://t.co/zCBJyo6lsN
@united Agent in LAS letting 20 customers know they can't help them rebook delayed flight to DEN #unfriendlyskies http://t.co/QuzVmK2rTR
@united empathizes w/ my disappointment that 1stClass flight w/nonworking entertainmnt is worth $50. #UnFriendlySkies http://t.co/lOecO4gmvd
@united ...and when that doesn't work...
@united searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn't find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play.  Earn miles but can't use them.
@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
@united still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here
@united or @flysaa has lost my baggage… heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!
@united I am signed up for notifications. This is the first trip I was not updated on. Not sure why this happened.
@united that is not in line with your responses here. And now I'm waiting until tomorrow morning because all the flights are overbooked.
@united I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change
@SouthwestAir doesn't charge ticket change fees. Do they not incur the same mysterious ""costs"" that you incur, @united?
@united Exhausted &amp; frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue https://t.co/LaRKC8vc4s
@united I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I'm not a rookie. Read my bio.
@united I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines
@united has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage's lost and there's no help but argument!
@united should NOT sell tickets for @SilverAirways on http://t.co/onhXHCO6bK.  has terrible service and UA staff cannot reach Silver
@united yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet
@united Lovely new plane from LGA to ORD but no power outlets?
@united I filed a delayed bag report on Saturday! my flight was Cancelled Flightled and I never went anywhere!
@united i need it there before she lands so she can have the EWR baggage claim file to have it sent but the employee has not droppeditoffyet
@united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i ""have"" to fly with you.
@united I did... no response back
@united this is atrocious customer service.
@united #albanyairport delayed departure to check bags at gate claiming space filled and walk on to open spaces a delay #poorcustomerservice
@united you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason &amp; now we have been on the phone for AN HOUR on our vacation. Why?
@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology
@united of course I did. The bag should be here by now :( #frustrated
@united you are the worst. I will avoid you like the plague.
@united is the worst airline in the world.
@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.
@united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.
@united I will give you one thing, you are consistent but unfortunately you are consistent at not doing your job well #AlwaysDelayedOnUnited
@united I will but right now I'm to angry
@united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @VirginAtlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines
@united I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to @SouthwestAir #CommunicationFail
@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
@united I'm saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around
@united I think DM would be better
@United gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth! @unfriendly
@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions &amp; you couldn't care less!....
@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
@united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..
@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
@united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable
@united has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed; cant wait to just get home
@united During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude.
@united  found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines.
@united by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper.
@united I'm trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted.
@united that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine!
@united how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter.
@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
@united my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help?
@united #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN.
@united Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement.
@united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?
@United We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb
@united Can't leave the Tarmac ..united's gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited
@united That's real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.
@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
@united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.
@united We've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that?
@united pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston
@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out.
@united is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I've never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass.
@united I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep.
@united @FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour!
@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.
@united Not a happy flyer.  UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland.  Sunday 2/22.  Stay tuned for blog article from http://t.co/VdFdODqVGx
@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
@united Heads up We didn't check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren't claim #s for our 2. Other people's bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD
@united This must be a drone “@united: @KeamBleam We understand your frustration. Our Bag team is working hard to get your bag(s) to you...""
@united flight attendant doesn’t understand not understanding English doesn’t mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted.
@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents 
@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.
@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?
@united I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap
@united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice
@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!
@united 45+ min at EWR baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous
@united On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence.
@united yes at 2am...but now back on a plane again and delayed again due to baggage loading issue... http://t.co/NfAQHhr09j
@united at what pt do u just Cancelled Flight!  Finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. What a day!  #missedWork #clientNotHappy http://t.co/sUPrLfOi8T
@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints
@united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes?
@united, this is the line in Denver to rebook due to weather issues. DO BETTER. http://t.co/tmccExYaaQ
@United the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don't understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent.
@united 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now?
@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are
@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
@United flight was scheduled for 11:56, it's 1:05 and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense
@united go to hell
@united since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don't u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed
@united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!
The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned.
@united Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I've used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable!
@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse
@united we've been here since 3am and you've Cancelled Flightled our flight twice
@united no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396
@united UA5396 can wait for me. I'm on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap.
@united better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight
@united is there a United gold number? I've been on hold 24 minutes and think I may be lost in nowhereland. Have a gold reservation. Help.
@united Oh, we are sure it's not planned, but it occurs absolutely consistently, it's usually the only YYJ flight that's Cancelled Flightled daily.
@united it's not getting any better. I'd suggest you get a senior manager to this gate , then retrain these gate people
@united @JMS2802 : nothing like supporting your own mechanics and maintenance workers...instead United puts out a video of TIMCO doing wifi.
@united already missed  connection ugh
@united How do I formally complain about your customer service handler who misconnected me. I was denied boarding &amp; I now lost my bag. Help!
@united there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour. Not given any info.
@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline w/out WiFi...and pls no 'unwind' BS.
@united u would not be able to rebook me to get home any sooner than a now 2hr delayed flight.  #linesforever #customerservice #fail #again
@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
@united that's cool - now what?
@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline without WiFi...
@united, b4 boarding this attendant took his shoe &amp;sock off at the desk and showed other agents his foot. So gross. http://t.co/755VpYm4Mv
@united Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-earned dollars is not fine.
@united your SFO-YYJ fight is Cancelled Flightled several times each week, why even bother?
@united, and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane BROKE. why am I global services status  on an airline that's unsafe? STUNNING
@united How do I get reimbursed for hotel and taxis for the Cancelled Flightation?
@united In 2015, United is ""unable"" to look up a flight reservation by passenger name at the YYZ check-in counter - WOW smh #customerservice
@united been on the phone for over an hour with customer service and they can't figure it out! awesome service... NOT!
@united
You really know how to piss people off. Your Farelock option is fake!
@united, last week shanghai to sfo 858 delay 5hrs bc of engine. today sfo-sea delay to ""sick pilot"". no compensation. They Do. Not. Care.
@united only thing confusing me is why I lost priority boarding? I'm a mileage plus card member 
@united We're hoping to hear from you actually.
@united It's the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than ""maintenance"".
@united b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best.  The problem isn't a Cancelled Flightled a flight.
@united a) she's an international. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out.
@united sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags
@united Okay thanks if you could please update me. I was told at the airport someone would call me today but they haven't.
@united gate C 24 IAD. U released passengers to board w/others deplaning .50 peopleOn bridge while next flight  board http://t.co/HfoF33iyhi
@united Cancelled Flights flt from EWR. ""No crew"".Tells wife &amp; 4 yr old to ""get to NY to catch @AirCanada"" to YYZ! Good #customerservice is dead.
@united Now arriving a day and a half Late Flightr than supposed to. Lesson of the day, don't believe verbal or written confirmations from United
@united Arriving at the airport 2 hours before departure time and still missing your flight bc you actually don't have an electronic ticket
@united 1.75 hour delay.  Nothing says sorry like a voucher.  Missing time with family.  #family #precioustime
@United has two whole people trying to schedule a flight's worth of missed connections. Shameful http://t.co/6kqLhVaP7G
@united is unfriendly screw family, that hates kids and moms. now waiting on  UA871... pray its better FYVRFN ..due to agent error and tickt
@united  gate agent at EWR "" if you are disabled or in a wheel chair, it's time to board, please step"". STEP UP??? Lol
@united it won't help...been there done that.
@united forces us to check our baby bag on overbooked flight complains to wife that we need to much for our baby.. united has no baby meals
@united today take flight to san francisco. .. refuse to let us board with baby early... time we board wont let us take baby carryon bag
@united we had four scheduled flights on this reservation and literally did not take one! Unreal
@united in ORD hotel issued to my 4yr old. Tickets needed fixing again another hour and 5 agents l8r nightmare still not over
@united 3 hours to rebook but 8 hours l8r the same problem again. Arrive at gate stopped cause now infant is sitting in 4 yr old lap
@united arrived in YYZ to take our flight to Taiwan. Reservation missing our ticket numbers. Slow agent Sukhdeep caused us to miss our flt.
@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR
@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
@united ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter's flt?? What's going on? Follow me so I can dm details.
@united Has it departed? I was awaiting an inbound plane yesterday for three hours and it never arrived. Had to stay overnight (again).
@united was that English? I'll DM though I don't think you'll make a plane appear.
@united looks like today will be my 6th consecutive delayed flight from you...do I win a prize??? @Southwest Air why don't you fly to SBA? 
@united sitting in a plane with no pilot.  Thanks! #waitingonapilot #denver #siouxfalls #whyairtravelsucks
@united already done that. the answer i got was... oops we can give you miles and we're very sorry. but who pays for my discomfort for 9 h?
@united Do we know why UA5282 is delayed x2)? This is getting crazy. I've already had 2 overnight delays. #UnitedAirlines
@united and most frustratingly, all this delay happened either at the gate, or even onboard the aircraft! No heads up in advance!!!
@united my UA3426 on 2/19 was also delayed by 2 hours, stretching my trip way past the midnight, extremely exhausting!
@united Ha… you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover &amp; are robbing me of a night with my family. Too Late Flight for that. Just fly on time for once.
@united switched to fly united from delta for the past two trips and was very disappointed. Now my UA4646 on 2/23 is delayed by 3 hours!!
@united  #UnitedAirlines  how long will1531 be delayed.
@united Why isn't the flight status updated to delayed UA1532 no board
@united I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? @VirginAmerica knows better..
@united i travelled from SCL- IHA feb 17. the AC on my sit (21L) was ON all night. I complaint to FA who never gave me a real answer. Help!
@united you suck.    9 hour delay?!
@united you are the worst airline in the world! From your crap website to your worthless app to your Late Flight flight. You SUCK! Just shut down.
@united 3866 is at a stand still! No pilot or paperwork for fix over 25mins! Problem was fixed 30mins ago. Flight is as is delayed!
@united. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn't police the overhead bins?
@united AN HOUR DELAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PRINT A PIECE OF PAPER!
@united 768 SFO to BOS and no internet it is 2015 what gives?
@united is the worst. Worst reservation policies. Worst costumer service. Worst worst worst. Congrats, @Delta you're not that bad!
@united I am trying to make/change reservations and getting extremely frustrated!!! Giving up and trying another airline!!!
@united Late Flight crew into #btv last nite delayed todays flt. Will miss connection to #cun. Why do I have to play for hotel tonight in #ewr?
@united no they aren't - I just called to check. #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
@united passengers should have been rerouted to match the intended arrival time (even if you have to incur cost to put us in other airlines)
@united need to work on your #United #flierfriendly program. At the very least, clue in your flight attendants.
@united space. Doctors' notes and everything. And on my first trip they lost my first suitcase. Among other issues- not pleased with #united
@united 's new #flierfriendly is garbage. Just had to cry to get attendant to find a place for my medical supplies with limited overhead
@united. epic fail. @reagan. no jetway. been here 15 mins on tarmac!
@united 2nd flight in two weeks that you have lost my bag!  Taking my 1K status to @AmericanAir #neveragain #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
@united UA1130 Flight was a nightmare!! From poor customer service,having my confirmed seat given away.... +more issues
@united Flight 683 last night was #bad4business. Will be a long time before I recommend United to anyone.
@united Beyond frustrated  Sked change = no seats, earlier departure and double layover.  Of course only seats are $$++.  Cust svc no help
@united working with Lisa J at ORD. she's working hard for us, but this is still VERY disappointing. was on 634 to EWR.
@united i emailed the customer care via the website form. After a long wait Rachelle resolved my issue. But I'm still irritated w/ united.
@united flight Cancelled Flightled,  and the updated one gets me into BWI too Late Flight! I'd be fine with DCA or IAD,  just arriving earlier!  Help!
@united so is the ^JJ standing for Just Joking?  I am not finding the humor.
@united you Cancelled Flight my flight. I wait in line to get rebooked, when I'm at the front you make me go to another gate and I lose my place.
@united you failed me last week at IAH. Next intl trip on Delta. Small ual flight from lax booked, that's it!
@united We were supposed to board at 605. They just brought the plane from the hanger! WTF did they not know there was a flight?1153 Lax-EWR
@united how about starting without the robotic response?
@united You can't control turbulence, but you can control customer experience, lot of scared people up here.
@united Currently on UA862, 20 minutes of the worst turbulence I've ever experienced, and ZERO communication from the flight deck.
@united yes, but it's not looking. The ticket agent at out terminal dismissed us and we missed a chance at a Miami flight then to DR
@united I have been told twice my issue has been resolved and twice it has not been. And when I write an email it bounces?! #worstservice
@united I'm on hold for the 4th time waiting for you to resolve and issue with a flight for my 6-year-old son. #terribleservice #NoService
@united as a freq flyer it makes me sad to see cust needing assistance treated so poorly. #ServiceFail
@united day 3 of this Saga maybe they'll finally make it home.Intentional or not it not gonna get them back there vacation days #badservice
@united No, thanks. I'm sick of your company's lousy excuse for customer service. I'm never flying United again.
@united current hold time AFTER speaking to rep to have tix reissued is 42 mins - why so long &amp; why not make this option available online?
@united I understand ppl make mistakes but don't code something in a way that we can't get reimbursed when it's YOUR fault. Just blatant LIE
@united also forgot add our bag is probably going to just sit in New Jersey because of a missed connection.
@united jx4s2t if you can out today would be great it's our honeymoon and this delay you has put a damper on iy
.@united Not what's been shared by the pilot with passengers!
@united WHERE IS MY RECEIPT! I upgraded return leg and 6 months Late Flightr still NO receipt! http://t.co/DAjWzhLVyu
@United how is it that I book a flight with a reserved seat and then go to check in and find out I have no seat?  WTF.
@united they're not, actually. gate agent was so rude. now standing in a line waiting for reFlight Booking Problems. missed the only flight to STI. awful.
@united I'm not sure you can do anything as this has been building up over time! Other than promises from your CEO service has gotten worse!
@united wi-fi on 737-800 (aircraft 3511) didn't work entire ORD-DCA flight this morning
@united Cancelled Flightled my direct flight Newark-Brussels last night, now 7 hours behind schedule. In EU compensation would be a given, but in US?
.@united You may ""dislike delays"" but I paid you .We had an agreement that I paid you and you got me to my destination at a certain time.
@united #epicfail on #CX as flight from Frankfurt to San Francisco now going to Chicago as flight crew out of hours due to de-icing delay
@united I'm aware of the flight details, thanks. Three hours Late Flight a crew that could not give less of a shit
@united Making sure your flights aren't delayed due to poor maintenance would be a start.
@united hilarious
@united hahahahaha ya tried that already
@United ""Your bag may or may not be at the airport. Unfortunately, no one at the airport is picking up the phone or responding to messages.""
@united funny I paid to check my bag and now flight 1086 is BEGGING folks to check bags for free 1 hour before flight. #notcool
@united unhappy with your new mileage rules :( - was my main reason to keep flying united. Will have to take my business elsewhere
@united I need assistance. Due to your incompetence I need to reschedule a connection. I will NEVER fly @United again.
@united you've been officially displaced by @DeltaAssist for better flight experience, pleasant cabin crew and timeliness. UA 1m switching!
@united @ShowExpert what is going on with United's Mileage Program? You pay $500 for a ticket and get a fraction of that as PQD credit?
@united you need to retrain your flight attendants. Saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is, is not cool.
UA3388 @united was Cancelled Flightled not delayed.  Re-Flight Booking Problems still 90 miles from home.  At least acknowledge the Cancelled Flightlation.
@united never ever again will I be Flight Booking Problems a flight with United or any affiliate if there is a chance to get on a United flight
@united three delayed flights and missed connections on first class flights and not get any compensation for losing those seats...
@united and after being on hold for an hour the day before to sort it out and being told it's fine it should be fine when you arrive to fly
@united well for a start it would be nice if your ticket was actually in the system when you change a flight
@united Another awful experience and Victoria at the check in desk in STL could not have been more rude and condescending.
@united no they did not want to deliver at my house. Had to go to sombrons else house
@united I guess you have to ""follow"" me in order for me to send you a DM.. I tried and it won't send.
@united Stopped flying @united 1 yr ago bc of aggressive policy on carryon @bdl listening to pssngrs forced to chk@preboard,#notcomingback
@united I have sent a message with a bag tag. Have you looked?
@united just sent you a message on Facebook, how do I follow up a complaint re. Missing clothing out of checked baggage?
@united why do I check in online if I still have to wait in line for an hour to ""check in"" at counter? #fuckinlame  @naia_miaa
@united very poor customer service. I WILL think again befor Flight Booking Problems another United flight.
@united an over booked flight to start with and a red eye from lax to bos with no reclining seat.... #lastflightwithyouever
@united - 75% of a plane's passengers boarding in your ""Premier"" groups might be an indication of a broken process.
@united Cancelled Flightled a flight cause the crew needed sleep.But it's totally okay to wake me up at 3am just to let me know it's Cancelled Flightled, again.
@united changed my last name for my MileagePlus acct on the site in an hour. @BA_USA had me on hold for 20mins, then 5 days &amp; no change yet
@united flight landed 13 hours ago, 2 more flights CMH-IAD last night and still no bag..could have driven it from CMH
@united Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS
@united I would encourage you to re-interview the sole flight attendant on UAL 6166 from BUF to ORD. Blatantly not stable. Uncomfortable.
@united this is the second time my flights been Cancelled Flightled... Like really?
@united really 1st flt frm IAD 2 IAH is - Late Flight &amp; -going via Nashville? #inconvenience. Downgraded but not on ticket
@united First complaint filed on Feb 11th, over 10 days now and still no response....disappointed but not surprised....
@united please stop spending mktg $ on branding ads. Use savings to improve #cxp. 1hr wait for luggage due to short staff is unacceptable
@united it's 430am and wife still doesn't have her luggage which was promised by 8pm and said to be on its way File number: DCA48810M #Fail
@united you are terrible.
@united I'm glad you didn't mean to, but it doesn't excuse your inefficiency! Only took 70min for the bags, we were your only arrival flight
@united I attempted to book a ticket 3 times and kept getting a 'error' message. I hope you didn't still charge me.
@united Coach interior on UA 992 looked like it was salvaged from the 80s. Tiny unusable video, no power &amp; lifevests on the floor #UA992 …
@united Now about two dozen back in line to see a single CSR for reFlight Booking Problems final leg. (Kiosks on fritz.)
@united aaaand 7 hours Late Flightr won't be catching a flight til 6AM...stuck in at airport in a snowstorm with no hotel-how's that for patience?
BUT @united just re-booked to BOS; UGGH!! now 3 hour bus to WMASS home. Could have flown to BDL &amp; back to DC in same time. #unitedairlines
@united you have now lost my bag. Never ever flying United again #joke
@united appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue
@united Missed UA1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure UA1543 (""uplink prob""). I will lose ~$400 in clients Mon. How can you compensate?
@United so you jacked out my cousins trip to Portland and then Cancelled Flightled her return trip?! No more United
@united after a Cancelled Flighted flight, and 2 delays, you lost my luggage AGAIN! You're the WORST! Disgraceful! Awful company, horrible service!
@united doesn't help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight.
@united 40 minutes on tarmac now. That's after 9 hour delay.
@united I am very glad I took care of own rescheduling now that UA 1580 from OGG was Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/H3k3oWOhD1
@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.
@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why...
@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??
@united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity
@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?
@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ
@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don’t see that it has taken off yet
@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?
@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means.
@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United
@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united
@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded
@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info.
@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS
@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!
@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away
@united it will be on a different airline.
@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
@united clicked ""upgrade now"" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59
@united you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can't be book. spent over 2 hours with united support
@united tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 returning 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can't be book!
@united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around.
@united Flight 472 from ORD couldn't let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. http://t.co/DQJl8vZ2h2
@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online
@united UA1731 - Denver to Austin...  Still on the ground...
@united either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight...
@united worst flights I've ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN
@united customers aren't dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think
@united bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That's not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA
@united yes I did. Terrible service from your courrier
@united compensate us for new clothes bet you won't
@united, we're stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =)
@united yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. And when time comes no plane 2nd day of work missed #hotelliving
@united currently crying... I wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. Just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams
@united I tried the online tracking and they said something like ""attempting to locate luggage""
@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?
@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
@united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'
@united really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc.
@united-rebooked to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business.
@united Thanks for the vague canned response that doesn't address the issue!
@united that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back
@united  Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed.
@united Why is my time less important to you?  #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail
@united airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this morning from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice
@united I did. It took about an hour and a half though
@united i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =(
@united WHERE IS MY FUCKING BAG?!?! Where the fuck is my fucking bag??? TELL ME NOW OR GIVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL A HUMAN. SAN68059M
@united Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn't let us on. http://t.co/xAToxBnsFa
@united time to give up my 1K status and switch to @Delta - you are so terrible I can't even describe.
@united You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.
@United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
@united Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
@United ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1
@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???
@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.
@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
@united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from São Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.
@united I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn't an option.
@united, wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It's now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484
@united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can't use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge
@united is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
@united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always
@united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.
@united sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent
@united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?
@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo.
@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
@united You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent
@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been
@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this
@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there.
@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
@united lol too little too Late Flight
@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
@united Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf
@united please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins.
@united Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief
@united your seats are god awful.
@united 3 hour 45 min delay so far..... Would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed!
@united I'm on UA1118 and my direct tv isn't working.  How do I avoid this in future?
@United is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don't believe gate agent that overhead is full; don't reserve aisle http://t.co/cdZhTyd0aK
@united i sure will
@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
@united strikes again! Why board anyone if there's something wrong with the plane? Common sense.
@united:  thanks for the miserable trip GNV&lt;&lt;&lt;FSD on 2.19-2.21.
@united Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting.  Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD???
@united always happy to start my life with my new wife with a 5 hr travel delay due to MAINTENECE and it would appear incompetence
@united is the airline of the Oscars but doesn't carry ABC on Direct TV?!?! Fail - now I can't watch the Oscars. #united
@united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines  you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work.
@united I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay.
@united I need help with a missing bag.
@united I was. But I have given up.
@united UA647 heading back to gate bc improper load? if ur packing us to the gills should at least take care to load bags. expecting comp...
@united is the worst airlines sitting on the plane at  Houston-bush airport now for an hour and a half waiting for Late Flight passengers
@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
@united deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited
@united Hey so many time changes for UA 1534. We going tonight or what? MIA - EWR
@united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse
@united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better
@united UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind.
@united thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while Newark tries to figure out which gate to go to. #incompetence
@united was so on point for 5/6 of my flights this past week . . But this last one really sucks shit
@United and here i thought American was bad. Horrible Service. Over 2:30 min Late Flight. No excuse!
@united UA1565 IAH -&gt; SJO is delayed by like 1.5 hours. Crazy!
@united I don't know my flight details bc I need to explore some options which I'm unable to do bc the site won't let me.Seems to be ongoing
@united How about free wifi when your flights delayed? Only 20 mins allowed!
@united CDG-LAS 42 hours. And my luggage is in SFO. I've been wearing the same clothes for 42 hours. Thank you. #flythefriendlyskies
@united this airline is a joke my friends been trapped in houston since 7am sat and have no flight in sight #unitedworstever #trappedhouston
@united why do you hate your passengers?
@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.
@united is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? http://t.co/NTUIx5dbYR
@united what a long day of delays. Please get us to Dallas tonight!!!!  Fingers crossed!!!  #winterstorm2015 #whichisworsedenordfw.
@united -How is it that all my flight times were changed without any official notification? Almost missed my flight this morning. Not cool!
@united they had record of it being at Denver on the concourse prior to me gettin on the shuttle. I just want to confirm its location
@united, there is no good word for describing how angry and pissed off of a customer you have made me.
@united Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever.  #UnitedAirlines
@united flight 3870 to Newark, stuck in the runway. About to miss my connection and they are just sorry for my inconvenience!!!!!!
@united false.
@united sitting on the runway in Newark, they won't let the plane to a gate. My connection boards in 1 minute. @united hates us all.
.@united all other ANA ticket holders get to use the lounge, too. But not us. Because United booked us. #grumpykim
@united Never had a flight delayed an hour due to an unbalanced load. And more delays at @flyLAXairport. Great job idiots.
@united 100. % failure in 2015 #UnitedAirlines
@united you guys suck, 2 1/2 delay to get out of ers and didn't even have curtesy to let me know,  #UnitedAirlines
@united Unfortunately had a bad experience flying with you on Saturday. Inpolite crew, bad delays.
@united seriously? 45 min on the plane at bhm and now 30 min in baggage and still no bags? #worstairlineever
@united been good 15yr ""friendly skies"" relationship. 2day agent told me I'm ""only Canadian"" and thus not good enough for military preboard
“@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” the service just hasn't been great.
.@united I think not. I'm not flying you again, if I can help it.
@united  always a fucken nightmare with your airline. #fail #lazy #alwaysLate Flight #worstairlineever
@united EVERYTIME I fly UR airline I hate you even more ! Thanks for the terrible service on flight 1071
.@united Really? Was bumped down from Gold status, asked to pay $$ to keep it, and get fewer miles... How is that worth it?
@united you always surprise me with the awfulness of your airline. You guys suck. #worst
@united that I would get on early enough to not have to green tag. but no go. if not for Otis I would be still sitting at ORD
@united customer service what's That???
@united -- overFlight Booking Problems planes, Departing delayed, Returning for 'more quick fixes' &amp; breaking out attitudy-customer service? #worstairline
@united Pay for a cab back to the airport to show baggage dept. my wet shirts and suit is not a viable option. 2nd time this has happened!!
@united that's what you have said for years, you are losing customers!!!!!!
@united. Once again your lack of customer centricity us astounding
@united Would be nice if @staralliance partner tickets that don't provide full PQM credit are more obvious before purchase. Lost 1,200 miles
@united now maintenance issues with flight 5639 and more issues with passengers that will miss connections needing to get off
@united seriously what's with the slow #wifi on this flight! If the speed was going to change for the worse then the price shouldn't go up!
. @united 5 hours, 3 gates, and 3 planes Late Flightr still not an update, explanation, or apology to be had. #WorstAirlineEver #UnitedAirlines
@united your gate attendant had some snobby remarks, your customer service is like playing poker with my sisters kids!
@united Poor cabin luggage service on UA1266 to BOS, I was forced to check in even when there was empty space for bags in the overhead!
@united no, we still have not heard anything from anyone at @united or the @ErieAirport
@united every time I search a flight your site logs me out and gives error message. About to book on a different airline and Cancelled Flight my card.
@united so the last seg of my flight from Denver (DEN) to hayden/steamboat (HDN) for 8am got Cancelled Flightled and I need help finding my luggage
@united 8 hours Late Flightr and I'm siting on another plane waiting to leave. I think a credit is in order for this terrible service!
@united We waited 40 min for our bags after a 45 min flight #nomorecheckedbags
@united yes I have &amp; they're unsure when it would come.This has never happened on any airline and my first time with @united #disappointed
@united of course. But interesting how United doesn't seem to have a good sense on what's happening with flight
@united pushing five hours and my time is worth nothing to you. reFlight Booking Problems not an option unfortunately.
@united you guys are complete ass
@united why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT.
@united - Plane came in with broken seat.  Rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids.
@united worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on ATC?! I watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min Late Flight
@united have you read your own same day travel change policy?
@united your b737-800w  literally the smallest seats I have ever have, my dad got stuck In the tiny bathroom ad well #disspointed #premier1k
@united my flight was already Cancelled Flightled this morning because of a ""snow storm in Denver"". And now I'm in DC waiting for a pilot to get on+
@united still sucks. I don't understand why you have two cust service agents for a long line at Houston international b gate #unitedsucks
@united the most frustrating flying experience. One continuous ""I dunno what time you will leave today. "". Dunno?! That's code for ...?
@united I'd rather spend two days in the back seat of a Volkswagen than two hours on your plane! #disgruntled #whatacluster
@united my flight was supposed to depart to Boston at 4:36 and now it's departing at 6:30 due to issues with finding a pilot. Thanks a lot!!
@united you could give me free flights for life, and I'd still choose to purchase my tickets from a competitor.
@united The first time I flew United was horrible thought I would give you a second chance. There will NOT be a third! #disgruntled
@united 4994 out of Jackson, Wyoming... Delayed by no pilots.. Full toilets.. Deplaned 2ndary to mechanical fail.. Cancelled Flightled flight pending
@united is by far THE WORST airline I've ever had the misfortune of flying with in all the 44 countries I've flown to!!! It's outrageous!
@united ... I want my bag off flight 1142, what do I do now?
@united thanks for causing us to miss our connection and now a 6hour delay #flydeltanexttime
@united I hope you lose the next govt contract
@united lost my bags and there was a flight from Chi to Eri that landed over 1.5 hrs ago...yet still have zero updates?? #UnitedAirlinesSux
@united i will just send my confirmation number when I get home safe and sound. This is why i pay so expensive services to you!
@united the bag is in a state that I didn't travel to and the airports don't fly to each other. Looks like it'll never show
@united ridiculous! I have to be refunded whenever I get at my final destination or not!
@united stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor
@united seriously?   UA 806.  Delayed because of the copilot isn't here?  For 1.5 hours and he is only flying from Raleigh? Disappointing
@united, we've been waiting for over an hour for our luggage- what gives?
@united the costumer services here at Denver Intl Airport is ridiculous bad!
@united Lied to my face at the gate about upgrades. Thanks. #badservice #unitedsucks
@united I have proof that my situation now is due to company mistake
@united ouch not fair
@united is synonymous to with #rude. And #cheap. You really don't know how to value the customer
@united I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it's unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling
@united if I miss the #Oscars I'll never fly united again
@united is the stingiest airline. Nobody should model after them. #PTFO #cheap #bastards #stingy
@united flight delayed...again...every time. ""Maintenance issues""
@united and I was denied an upgrade because of catering issues??? #poorservice
@united--excited to barrel through the sky at 600mph on a 75 ton piece of metal operated by a company that can't get their tiny TVs to work!
@united, maybe don't play the video about how your flights are outfitted w wifi on the flights where wifi isn't working...✈️
@united on line baggage system complete rubbish. bag missing 2 days. No meaningful information.
@united so unhelpful... http://t.co/vBfIeo2qJC
@united I would take the $500 voucher you offered for MISCOUNTING THE # OF SEATS ON YOUR PLANE but that means I would have to fly you again
@united - 3 of 6 First seats open on UA5097. No upgrades processed. Gate agents @yyz said their too busy. Not cool http://t.co/6KpyhckA9l
@united @rayja9 flying to las vegas out of Chicago flight is Late Flight and no announcement has been made
@united I believe. It was Cancelled Flighted yesterday I guess. Goes back to no notification from United about Cancelled Flightlation
@United - In case you're reading this, UA230, right now, 7D. So many oversized carryons taking up too much room. Enforce your rules.
@United is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight, there's no overhead space.
@united Delayed 7 hrs flight 5721 PIT/IAD, finally board the plane, sit half hour &amp; crew is at their hrs limit &amp; we deplane. Unacceptable.
@united stuck in YYZ because staff took a break? Not happy 1K....
@united pls stop sending texts every 15mins saying my flight is delayed another 15mins-It's been 3hrs. I usually defend u but this is lame..
@united agent, ""You should use the bathroom before boarding.. Toilets onboard are full."" Oh you can expected a strongly worded email FUnited
@united should hire extra customer service reps. 50 minute wait time to ask one question? I would rather just fly another airline, thanks.
@united united flight UA3774 after two delays just Cancelled Flightled no explanation &amp; no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.
@united any way you can help me find a flight to LAS? Stuck in DIA, sat on plane 2 hrs, now been waiting an hour for an update.
@United 50 minute wait times to help with a Cancelled Flightled flight?? Help a guy out?
@United You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO.
@united Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me
@united thank you for letting me down.My luggage is still in Denver but I'm in Phl. #neveragain #flyingwithUS #disappointed #lostacustomer
@united can you get me on the delayed flight to EWR out of YYZ at 15:30? No customer service to be found in airport
@united flight UA3774 after two delays. just Cancelled Flightled and no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.
@united thanks for having no one to pilot my last two flights, and all but stranding me in Houston tonight.  Airlines are the absolute worst
@united so disgusted and disappointed with united airlines luggage policies and attitude toward musicians. Unacceptable
@united missing my amazing us bank work conference, not ok.  What do I do now?????
@united ... frozen lines on flight, not continuing due to 'passenger comfort'? Not ok, sat on the plane as long as a flight to Vegas would !
@united has terrible customer service &amp; doesn't feel the need to notify its customers when their flights are delayed
@united I have tried and you have failed. Still no wifi ever, last row in the middle and I fly every week. Thanks for nothing.
@united trying to check in for tomorrow's flight. website keeps timing out. what's up?
@united yes, computer would allow me to get to San Diego quick but customer service will not help.  Says can't rebook http://t.co/KcVUbUYExc
@United says we had a weather delay in #YXE this morning. The ""weather"" didn't affect any other airline. #UA6136 http://t.co/4JdvK8tCqx
@united It was Cancelled Flightled, none of the passengers were notified. Complete violation of travelers' rights.  @AerocivilCol
@united thanks for ruined my vacation for having poorly maintained aircrafts that can’t fly safely out of STT. #UA1481 #Cancelled Flightledflight
“@united:That's not something we like to hear. Hopefully our staff can resolve &amp; have you on your way ASAP. ^ML”:3:15 &amp; still not resolved
@united Waiting for 3494 EWR-ORD, delayed 47 mins. Might miss 5491 ORD-YWG at 6pm CT. Any room on 5644 ORD-YWG in case I miss connex?
@united - well, now finally on board hopefully we take off this time and quickly. Well over an hour delay!!
@united I missed my connection already. Then I missed the next flight they put me on.  Now I'm going to LAX instead of Hawaii.  :(
@united reservation was made last July. I want to know why I wasn't reseated. This only happens on international itineraries
@united line full of worried customers and guy at desk says so sorry you will have to take care of your problems Late Flightr I don't have time.
@united 

There must be 100 people waiting in line for customer service at DEN to deal with flight Cancelled Flightations.
@united, American never had my bags apparently. United never switched them over. Had to go back to United Baggage Service.
@united unacceptable. 403 was 90 min Late Flight for a 'missing screw' our flight to Tucson left before we even landed
@united CMH gate staff a disaster..#3345 overbooked, no volunteers, no boarding, 20 min Late Flight trying to figure out issue #bringbackrealstaff
@united Waiting half an hour for my checked bag at EWR (&amp; that was Priority); disappointing, usually you guys are good.
@united Are your earnings so low that checkin people have to also be on Tarmac loading bags? JAN
@united thank you for dishonoring my upgrade and putting me in a seat I didn't want, all while not even notifying me.  Great 1K service 
@united you guys are gay
@united the emails/calls over the past months about flight changes were helpful wish you would have sent them on the Cancelled Flightlation yesterday
@united - so they changed depart from 1:45 to 2:00pm &amp; it is now 1:40pm &amp; the Capt. just got off the plane to find a smoothie, 2pm my ass!!!
@united  Thanks for nothing! No Atlanta Lounge? Your Ap says NO. Sure nothing at Terminal T http://t.co/tFjfMSHa2k
@united it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate
@united a baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit, what are you going to do about this?
@united You cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not. No empathy from gate staff or crew, no apology. Really?
@United rescheduled my return flight from #Japan?  Uh why?  Trying to call #UnitedAirlines #customerservice - 45 min wait.  #fun
@united is by far the worst airline ever 
@united I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better.
@united I'm DMing my info and no is assisting. My flight home left before m first flight had even landed
@united Boston is all self service. Swipe yr own boarding pass at gate. Most difficult: Tag your own bag. Not easy! #ImproveTheProcess
@united more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help!
@United no consistency, #Denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing FAA. Your website policy says otherwise. #time2switch
Only 14 biz days (18 calendar) to respond to my inquiry @united ?  I hope your standards are universally adopted :-/ #BadCustomerService
@united Thanks but why did this occur? You guys had 3 hours extra to get my bag on due to your delay. So that's 7 hours you had. #fail!
@united so many delays today...What's up with that? Hoping my 12:26pm flight boards soon. #United #premier1K
@united your website is fucked up. Now instead of a $416 flight I should’ve had yesterday, it’s $514 today. Thanks.
@united called back and I've been on hold. What is the issue?! I have a confirmation number and an email that shows how much I've paid
@united I'm not sure how you can help. Your flight experience is terrible, planes are dirty and staff is rude. Start over perhaps?
@united check in and it's still saying I haven't paid. I've called back twice was on hold for 30 minutes then they answered and hung up. I
@united hold for 30 minutes finally got someone and they retook my form of payment and confirmed that my reservation was set. I tried to
@united I bought a ticket yesterday and received a confirmation. Tried to check in and they said I hadn't paid for it. So I called was on
@united delayed because of salt on the floor from previous passengers? The 180 of just just want to fly, don't care about our shoes. Ua649
@united @czamkoff It's all about profit, and they don't really give a damn about paying customers!!!! #greed
@united I unfortunately didn't get her name :( she was not nice!
@united  what did you do with my seat. International connection. Seriously?
@united My bag is lost and I can't get ahold of anyone that can help
@united Then you delete my return ticket to Europe and blame me for the now show? This airline is a joke. 3 times this happened now.3 times!
@united When my United flight arrives Late Flight and I'm told to re-book my connecting United flight, you characterize that as a ""no show""
@united never flying United again! Worst experience ever
@united @TiffanyAndCo @NTrustOpen ah, so that's where the funds to fix the broken plane upon which I sat for 4 hrs on IAH runway went.
@united cannot direct message you you do not follow us. I want my luggage.  Please hep
@united flight 5903 stranded on Tarmac in Chicago. No gates available?! Plane getting very hot and uncomfortable.
@united we rebooked and disappointed we have to wait a whole day to start our vacation. At these fares United should have top notch service
@united I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What's worse is plane is here but crew can't fly!!
@united   Pushing 2 hours on hold. Priceless. http://t.co/thS10LDY2a
@united read the thread. I booked 1st class , now seated at 38E even though United Twtr account confirmed Eco Premium.
@united Hi there bag ID is UA6016053916 can you update me and explain why is occurred when I arrived 4 hours before flight!
@united hi yes need a free hotel stay in Honalulu due to 4 hour delayUA53, since we will miss our second flight to Kauai
@united is screwing with my flights again at CAE? Why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get Cancelled Flighted?
@united no. I need you to have more than 2 agents at check in.
@united so this did not work out at all!! Incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over Twitter @theairhelper
@united The so below skilled staff and inadequate system just deleted my return from Houston to Norway. Shoulder shrugging is all you do..
@united severely under staffed at Iah.
@united this 2 hr delay is a vacation buzzkill
@united really enjoying my Sunday on hold...over 1 hour. Perhaps a better client experience is needed. http://t.co/8VnCKgZxl1
@united broken light, 35 mins to get bridge to gate, airplane parked wrong , bathroom not emptied last night....your airline in last 3 hrs
@united I would appreciate a response regarding the pressurization failure on flight 1109. You seem to be responding to less serious issues
@united once again you guys didn't let me down, a four hour delay to Honolulu from Houston, thanks for the train wreck of issues now coming
@united not for me.  I am on another Ua flight 2 gates down that was held 15 mins for cnx pax.
“@united: @4geiger It looks like form the photo that something burst out of your luggage. Is this correct? ^JH” always blame the customer
@united it's boarding time for ua3882 but no crewe
@united no way one person is working entire security checkpoint in EWR 
@united who authors this fiction? I just heard on radio we don't even have a jetway secured yet #UA5037 #CMH http://t.co/T78k7aBtWF
@united so? Found anything or just showing off? You do realise that the morning flight that you Cancelled Flightled was more pricey than the evening?
@united oh I did. Was still lost. Your tracking system stinks as does the delivery system.
@united feeling like a true united customer stuck.on the tarmac in dc for over 2 hrs. UNITEDFAIL
@united leadership counts. landed at 11:15 last night-deplaned at 12:40. 45 minutes of that was waiting for the jetway. Inexcusable
@united I sent you a DM as requested but have not heard anything. Can you address the issue I brought up in my DM and explain what happened?
@united employee=faceless. Don't throw them under the bus. Starts with management. I'm almost a million miler and own my own company. 1/2
@united you can't say the flight is pulled in and departs in 2 mins if boarding hasn't even started! http://t.co/2IKbP8gxWi
@united  I understand that but why should I pay to change if it was a problem with your plane. If it was weather I would understand
@united 30 hours Late Flightr still no answers stuck in Houston. Keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #BadCustomerService
@united you guys are horrible! First we get stuck in the snow for a hr in ewr now sitting in cmh saying it could be 30min for a gate
@united the hotel you sent us to wouldnt take the voucher. Our flight was delayed, then Cancelled Flightled, then delayed again. 32 hours and counting
@united DM'd you 4 hrs ago at your request. No response to be found .... just like my bag.
@united two hour delay for a plane that was visible from the airport. So far terrible customer service. #neveragain
@united as if a 4 hour maintenance delay wasn't enuf, u charge me $25/bag as a global service platinum mbr. Get ur shit together
@united last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. Another flight last week was Cancelled Flighted. Your track record is the WORST!
@united you should spend all of the money you take for our tickets and update your planes! Each flight has a maintenance issue!!!
@united any chance you could help rebook?? My flight Cancelled Flightled
@united you really need a better system for handling Cancelled Flightled flights http://t.co/3uBCoAsyws
@united It is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on Late Flightr
@United give me a direct number I can call regarding my lost baggage immediately.
@united involuntarily bumped your passenger and can't guarantee them another flight for three days!
@united Please follow FAA guidelines regarding bumping. It is NOT acceptable to give a $300 voucher for an $800 fare when you've
@united I did already rebook, and now I will miss my first appointments in London tomorrow morning. Thanks for ruining my trip - AGAIN!
.@united Our newest delay, right now http://t.co/96fTLZWtvO
@united. If you show available seats, you need to honor that! I shouldnt spend 1hr on phone to hear that ""really there are 3 not 4 seats""
@united 50 min on hold trying to book award flight because site errors out.  Agents ask for my pin to see platinum availability??? badbadbad
@united is a joke.  Lots of angry people at IAH this AM.
@united completely unacceptable to seat 1st class passenger into middle seat in 38 (not even premium economy)
@united Found flight after 2.5 hrs. How am I offered a $200 flight voucher 12 hrs before, lose my seat out of neglect, then get nothing?
@united right as we think we will take off, we stop to get de-iced. Why wasn't this done when the planes were sitting out all night?
@united two service agents hung up on me the third was able to get me a flight on US air today. Three calls and 2.5 hours to get a flight
@united Delayed more and more these days. MCO &gt; IAD. Fingers crossed I make my connection home to Albany. #united1K
@united your first class is a joke, compared to all the others I have flown, don't ask for extra peanuts... That's NOT allowed! @AirCanada
@united I have been given a connection with 2 overnight layovers. No vouchers. Last connection not even confirmed.
@united I would like your baggage damage number as well! Another great thing from your 'trained' staff! Whats the number please.. Claim time
@united 100% I will put together a very serious email, with all the issues that arose on our vacation due to your staff I will post it here
@united the long wait was the icing on the cake. Why don't you fix your reservation system so the confirm # doesn't get changed mid-travel
@united you guys SUCK! Another Cancelled Flighted flight! Every flight with you has an issue!
@united, more lies... http://t.co/BEqoTLNugc
@united they wouldn't let me on. Real nice of you! Just love your awesome service. And U have 2 people working this customer service line..
@united after 6 hour plus delay from #WashingtonDC finally on flight to #Edinburgh all very tired
@united, I don't believe that you do.. http://t.co/7z3GqEBfK2
@united : flight delayed by 24 hours, lost my wallet, have no money to eat or sleep yet your representatives will not help.#unitedsucks
@united lost 4 loyal customers and mileage plus card holders. We could have driven to Florida from Pa quicker both ways! Worst trip ever!
@united why don't you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? Or we could just delay :/
@united fuck you for not caring 
@united 20 minutes plus to get through to a two after the first one transferred me to a spanish hotline is unacceptable!
@united @delta lost my luggage from ATL to  hdn luggage in denver and said @united will deliver my luggage to HDN airport claim# hdndl11785
@united If United loses your baggage they will get it to the airport in the country your in and then it disappears!
@united Thank you for wasting my time &amp; money. Not only will I now arrive 5 hours Late Flight to my destination, but...
@United DO NOT FLY UNITED WITH CHECKED BAGGAGE! It will never find you!
@United why can't you have an English/Spanish rep call me so we can locate my bag and resolve this issue?
@united why would you overnight my bag Wed to an unknown location with a courier company you apparently can't contact!
@united Hey, thanks again for helping me miss my buddies 30th bday, you guys are really a trashy company #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks
@united I have never been more frustrated than my conversations with United who can't speak Spanish to the courier company that has my bag!
@united I have never been mislead by a company as many times as I have this week by United Airlines!
@united I would never fly United Airlines again!
@united I am still in the airport waiting for my flight.
@united your airline has been telling me that my luggage is one hour away from my destination for 5 days!
@united now there is no one to operate the ramp to let us out of the plane in IAH...wow..just wow
@united Cancelled Flights your flight then sends you an email saying ""think about your next flight..."" #customer #outrage http://t.co/KkwiwI97A4
@united did your super computer  ots pants? Lots of cranky people in line at CMH reFlight Booking Problems, delaying check-ins of on-time, direct flyers
@united is your check-in system down? I'm having trouble checking in for a flight that departs in less than 24 hrs.
@united, fuck you and your closed premier access lines at ORD. Probably gonna miss my flight...Start treating your customers better.
@united Good luck with the no-enertainment-on-6-hour-flights strategy. Innovation at work. Hello @jetblue http://t.co/HI76BOavXY
@united no HUMAN contact for 2 mths from @AmericanAir cust relations or refund dept. If ever a problem do u have humans I can talk to?
@united you would think you would clean your ramps. Our jet is stuck in the snow in Newark. This would never happen with @Delta
@united I would understand if weather was the issue, but bc of airline maintenance I had to sleep on an airport floor and lose an entire day
@united flight 403 is delayed 40 min bc a missing screw and were in danger of missing flight 6491
@united no, ua 6 finally Cancelled Flighted after hrs of delay. The replacement flight leaves Late FlightR than this one was scheduled tomorrow. Not cool.
@united overbooked by FIFTY people?!? the worst.
@united your service need work - check out this Bush airport ""customer service line"" last nt #unitedagainstunited http://t.co/g00sAozgtv
@united Also, your phone customer service is almost useless. http://t.co/Mb3bJwGOAp
@united lost bag on next flight. Didn't have time to load during the 5 hour delay?Consequence from platinum to gold
@united A day Late Flightr, one delayed &amp; one Cancelled Flightled flight, I'm at a gate with no seat assign. Lots of standby ppl also waiting.
@united What does delayed due to Customer Service mean for UA761?
@united wifi wasn't working onboard.Alerted attendant re socket.You sent me to a hotel for 24 hours with 7$ Vouchers??no wifi at hotel
@united I'm not sure it will have ""next time""...
@united now the weight restriction? 'We'll try to get as many of you as we can on this plane'
@united Conference begins in 3 hours. Up all night due to delays and still waiting to talk to someone about lost luggage.
@united is 4:30am and I am in the customer service line trying not to scream. #epicfailunited
@united flighted delayed for hours. 10pm arrival to Vegas is now 4am. Did you seriously lose my luggage???
@united 2100$ ticket,12h biz trvl,no wifi.Missed con flt,next one#24h,missed meeting,7$ food voucher,hotel chkout#12,flt#5,no wifi#hotel
@united still missing my luggage, was promised someone would call, no call so far, flight from Shanghai to DC with connecting flight in ORD
@united you Cancelled Flightled my flight without notification?
@united  once again your customer service at the providence airport was horrible. Do you actually care about customers or just making money?
@united you have Cancelled Flightled my flight UA922 for aircrft maintenance. I'm delayed 10 hours now. What's my refund options?
@united where is my bag?? I'm in Mexico about to go build a house &amp; my suitcase never got on my flight from CLE w me. I need it. SAN68059M
@united you told me you changed my flight and im in the ottawa airport and AC cant find my reservation! Whats wrong with you
@united This has been the WORST flight experience I've ever had. Thank you for ending my vacation on such a bad note.
@united hey, it's 4am, guess what I'm doing? Not sleeping! Why? Cause you care so little about your customers you let them sleep in airports
@united no my concerns were not addressed
@united DUH and done. bag whereabouts unknown. Greeeaat
@united thanks for letting me sleep at DIA to ensure you ruin as much of my vacation as possible. Wait, no, fuck you. #unitedairlinessucks
@united oh, I'll be sharing alright. Especially about sleeping in this shitty airport and getting 1hr of sleep all night because UA.
@united @MaxAbrahms *if* he needs assistance? Do you expect him to go on a Scooby Doo tour of terminals until he finds his stuff?
Thanks @united for writing back. To assist you can return the bag you lost &amp; clean up the feces sprinkled in your bathroom. Too much to ask?
@united you hung up on me again.
@united your ""customer service"" team in manilla is absolute shit. I can't even get a supervisor without being out back on hold?!
@united it's disgusting and unconscionable the treatment I've received tonight.
@united of course I would like hepl! Are you kidding me? That's the ONLY reason I've been on hold for the past 5 hours!
@united @ThisIsCoach Every time my united flight got delayed. this is a big frustration.
@united you've got to be kidding me. I still haven't talked to a human and your robotweeting me?! And asking for a follow????
.@united I wouldn't describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost &amp; return it.
@united and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best
@united is that all that matters, not the fact that we're at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress,
@united 1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag  gee thnx. UA922 awesome job
@united absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. Isn't there anyone actively monitoring your Cust serve? This is  unreal!!
@united averaging 200 minute wait times tonight or what? I've gotten no help from you tonight.
@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.
@united you're customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I've been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x.
@united you can read the full story when I submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight 6232 and why we are sleeping in DIA
@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
@united I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why?
@united new 737 plane; wifi: not working. Entertainment: non existent. New Seats: seriously uncomfortable. Really? #unitedfail UA1550
@united where is our luggage
@united screws up again...to be expected! NEVER AGAIN!
@united why don't you allow families with small children to board first anymore? Our next flight will be on another airline...
@united flight Cancelled Flightled to Denver service agent offered me a non jet salt lake to Denver or red eye out of Atlanta then hung up on me.
@united That's called throwing ""loyalty"" out the window and trying to give less awards.
@united your unhelpful team? Sure I did. I'm in Bangkok, my bag in Chicago. Are u going to pay for my accommodation s until my bag arrives??
@united that's not an apology. Say it.
@united been on hold for almost two hours trying to talk to someone about a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning. What do you suggest?
@united no apology? Cool.
@united you ask a lot of customers who  you routinely screw over. You know that, right?
@united I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers, I have plans and no answers....
@united somehow I knew that you'd wait until I was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain.
@united Missing flight attendant = Delayed Flight. Prime example how 1 person impacts 100's of people. HNL -&gt; IAH (UA252) #wastedtime
@united has me stranded in Texas and then hangs up on me when I'm trying to figure out how to get home. Cool.
@united we have tried to change our flight THREE times on the phone and got disconnected each time.
@united poor showing today, no assistance to passengers who mis connected due to maintenance and waiting for baggage
@united has been showing the same tone deaf video for all these years about how ""wifi is coming!"" Hah.Not before I leave. @VirginAmerica ftw
@united more people stranded cause you suck. Better yet, you weasel out of Flight Booking Problems rooms for people claiming weather http://t.co/Flcnnn2USD
@united look at all the delta flights that landed while your pilots claimed they couldn't fly 6232 to JAC. http://t.co/6Kp4m0R1f7
@united Been sitting on flight 435 for an hour after landing in Newark. First no gate, then no jetway operator. Seriously!?
@united worst customer service experience ever. 40 minutes to get the jetway to the plane at EWR tonight. Flight 354   Disappointed
@united - not only 2 hour delay - double booked seat nit parked at wrong gate - incompetence at its finest - been waiting  for over 1 hr
@united look at the people tryn to sleep in the airport due to your shitty company not comping rooms after cxl flight http://t.co/o1u96Xc3bo
@United - routing a person from Houston to Newark, NJ  and then to SFO is not acceptable.
@united 25 minute hold is 1 hr. 25 min. @ABC11_WTVD
@united 20 yrs of flying Continental/united exclusively I get why everyone hates you - fl1289sfo/EWR #getmeoffrhisFUCKINplane
@united I'm still trying to get things worked out and you have yet to respond back.
@united screwed up our reservation- they assigned a new # to just one of us &amp; when they changed our flight, only changed the original #.
@united 25 min hold has now progressed to over an hour...919-675-0985
@united YOU SUCK!
@united how can u not have gate ready or gate agent for going on hour two
@united had a different fiasco on my outward trip and was rebooked on to qantas lax-Syd. No FF miles show up in my account for that :(
@united it would be great to get a callback from the agent that disconnected me trying to put me on hold after waiting to connectfor 60+min
@united not a good day to fly u, two delayed flights still on plane at Ewr waiting over 1,5 hours for gate get to gate no gate agent.
@united my luggage is set to go to DCA however, I am rerouted to Dulles. Currently in NOLO however bags are in Houston. Can you fix this?
@united I'm extremely disappointed w my service for this trip as a #United #MileagePlus Explorer Card holder.
@united I hope your corporate office is ready to deal with the rage created by your shitty service and bullshit pilots. #UnitedAirlinesSucks
@united i will never fly with you again. i went on vacation this week and you lost my bags both ways. now i have no clothes. thankyou
@united sadly this wasnt just due to mother nature investigate this incident and your employees at sfo. Terrible customer experience
@united flight ua90 is taking off now after 1750 was delayed over 4 hrs 30 passengers to miss their flight to tel aviv
@united 30 of us on flight 1750 trying to get to tel aviv that is trying to take off right now with out us so cruel. Next flight is 350pm
@united Airline SUCKS! Customer Service SUCKS! NO courtesy! Incompetent - passengers do NOT matter- Bet the CEO is just doing fine though!
@United also ran out of water and refused service #costumerservice #legit #jk
@united on a 4 seg flt yvr to zurich, why would you credit all miles and but only 2 segs on full fare?
@united 6377 and now they sent our green tagged bags to the luggage carousel. It's been one mess up after another. Bad day @united
@united the lounge tells us they have no pillows for my grandma as one of the ladies opens the closet and I see 2 right there. #unitedlies
@united the drunk guy you threw out of flight UA936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food.
@united sitting in Denver airport waiting for a plane to be refueled. For an hour and a half! Hurry the fuck up United, you fucking retards
@united I'm rebooked on a flight tomorrow even though I had 1st class seat orig I have a lousy coach seat
@united well this one missed the mark.  She was in a snit from the minute I stepped up to the counter
@united who compensates is for the delays caused by the fact that you don't have enough flight attendants?? http://t.co/96apr35qan
@united we've been seating for 5hrs inside flight UA936 at #IAD delayed. We've only been offered water &amp; cookies in business class. #failed
@united please get me off this plane #UA57
@united have since dropped to 2 layovers but still not acceptable.
@united our 1 layover itinerary was swapped for a 3 layover itinerary - really?!?
@united your app says flight UA936 to #ZRH departed 2:45hrs Late Flight, but 5 hours Late Flightr we are still seating inside the plane in #IAD.  #failed
@united not completely.  Our flight was changed in July but we never received notification.
@united has once again earned a place as the worst airline in the business
@united I'm trying your WiFi on UA1616. But sorry it really slow. Even #Spotify lagging and that isn't a hard stream.
@united flight UA1459 sitting at newark waiting for a gate, seriously??? #threehoursLate Flight
@united why don't you ever print my known #traveler number on my ticket? Because of this I never get to use the #TSA prescreen I paid for
@united boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don't speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much
@united flight was Cancelled Flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed.
@united it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would ""sit awhile"" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm.
@united had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I'll never have to fly @united ever again ..
@united I'd really like to get off of this plane now.
@united possibly the worst airlineGave them three chances Second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or Cancelled Flightled due to mechanics
@united cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious. Flight 1109 landed in Washington because of it. My head is pounding.
@united Sandra at ur international checkin counter was rude and offensive.  She commented she didn't care if I complained cuz she had 25yrs
@united Did I mention that I was ON THE PLANE so is my luggage. My luggage that I'm not going to have for how many days.
@united 3 times I've called customer services each at least 40 mins... Each time cut off by your operators... Why can't you call me back!
@united Tell me that you're at least going to cover a room and get me out of here.
@united OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse.
@united Which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever.
@united Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to ""Try again Late Flightr"".
@united please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks
@United - flight Cancelled Flightled. 4 hrs at airport to book a new one for $95. Just got two invoices for the flight, each for approx $300. Really?!
@united why do you hire POS pilots? Thanks for ruining my trip and not allowing me to see my buddy as he turns 30. #unitedsucksdick
.@united Your airline is again rated the WORST in America so you've got your work cut out for you. It's bc you treat customers like garbage.
@united Pay for my hotel.... I'm a broke student #help
@united what a nightmare!!  Both sides of my flights are a disaster!  At Houston getting attitude cuz I was sent to ticket counter
@united you're terrible.
@united it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. Will be sent on. But I won't be for days!
@united EWR TO MCO made unplanned landing because of pressurization failure. Worst pain I've EVER felt, I thought I was going to pass out
@united How does that make a flight takeoff on time? And regardless it makes me Late Flight because now I have to wait for my bag at baggage claim.
@united it's been over 3 hours...at what point do you let people off of the plane? @FoxNews @CNN @msnbc
@united trying to get a customer service agent.  Just landed in SFO.  Can't fly with 3 layovers with 3 kids!!
@united nope I gave up - maybe they'll deliver it
@united more and more delays! No CS help at all! No notifications!
@united and waiting
@united the incompetence is truly stunning at this point. 4 hours on a plane for a 1.75 hour nonstop flight.
@united 1st u delay my flight for mechanical failure,then 2 hrs on the runway, &amp; 13 hrs Late Flightr I'm still here with a lost bag &amp; no resolution
@united is the worst
@united still waiting
@united thanks for the reply. To clarify, the airfare is similar to your likely intended peer group. The $3 beer charge, however, is not
@united...lies lies lies....still sitting at the gate, have not moved an inch http://t.co/LulGnwEfFH
@united &amp; finally he was told he couldnt use the front of plane restrm (he was row7) though myself/others in rows behind him used w/no issue
@united #customerservice at @Dulles_Airport could not be worse. I get the bad weather, but this is awful.
@united instead of be told when we board, we have to wait for the emails telling us about the delays.
@united Additionally, my husband paid for tv service &amp; it stopped working about halfway through the flight.
@united unfortunately, they didn't. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would
@united I sent a PM over two weeks ago and have heard nothing!  #horribleservice #unitedsucks
@united And yet we still haven't left yet and I can't watch my pre-paid DirectTV. #firstworldproblems
@united yr team have me on hold for over an hour unhelpful Pls can you answer my question.
.@united Let us know when you find everyone's luggage. Thanks. #UnitedAirlines
@united Nope! I'm on UA 174 that was supposed to leave at 6:47 but are still at the gate. Apparently we are about to pull back and de-ice.
@united Still do not have my bag, it's in the CLT airport. Was originally told I would have it by 2pm.
@united just texted me to say flight is delayed due to air traffic control. BS! They pulled the plane in Late Flight #lies
@united 6 minutes to boarding at b12 in Ord. No sign of gate agent. A little help?
@united website says my flight is on time. It leaves in 15 min and nobody has boarded yet. #pathetic #needtobehonest
@united From the air: Another missed cnxn 2day. ATC went on strike in Belize this AM. Now family &amp; I miss cnxn in EWR. Please see my DMs.
@united we are the airline that has Cancelled Flightled flights TOMORROW to the NYC area
@united having to pay for a hotel room in Cleveland because of last minute Cancelled Flightled connecting flight. Booked through united..Unimpressed!
@united Flight has been delayed for another hour so only have 24 mins to transit at LAX... Extremely unlikely I will make it!
@united 4595. We are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.Love United but this stinks
@united congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can't leave.
@united thank you for leaving my bag in houston! despite what your system says, i was definitely on the flight!
@united how come a $27 shuttle bus from LGA to EWR has electrical power outlets but our new Airbus interiors do not? #whyjeff?
@united 15-hr flight w/broken #Dreamliner media system. Witness #mental #breakdown as we bounce off walls. Remind me why I'm 1K.
@united I was rebooked thru SFO but arrive 9 hours Late Flight and miss activities. I asked to fly today with stop over. Was told I'd have to pay.
@united never again.
@united is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.
@united  your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest
@united fire yr rep who refused to put me on a flight that I had a boarding pass and seat on. Full explanation and her name in complaint.
@united God damn fucking crew won't be here till 6:40, so you've known for over an hour and a half the flight time was bullshit.
@united you really do have a culture problem. Everyone I tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they're short staffed
@united sucks.
@united I can understand that but to not have another plane available when there is a full day till departure is unacceptable. Phoenix?
@united is honestly RUINING MY FUCKING LIFE RIGHT NOW. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@united Flight Cancelled Flightled to BDL and stranded @Dulles_Airport. Waiting almost 2hrs at customer service. Shout out to diligent agents.
@united No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp; each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. #disappointed
@united We've let you know how to help the millions of customers you've treated like garbage. It's no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline.
@united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.
@united Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212
@united If you follow me I will DM you my phone # which you can call.
@united Flight:UA1750 is basically a prison on the runway @ SFO 6delays 4hrs of sitting no water no answers. reminded y I hate this airline
@united says @USAirways  is the final carrier . Us air doesnt have it. I want my bag!!! Not a claim not an im  sorry. I want my clothes!!
@united seriously? 2-4 hrs to get bags from IAD intl arvls to carousel 2 for custs w/Cancelled Flightled connects? I understand irrops but ridiculous!
@united most terrible flight experience happening to everyone right now on Flight:UA1750 6 delays 4 hrs total missed all my flights now thnx
@united @USAirways @AmericanAir @americanone one of you has my bag! Claim 4016688561 and i want it in MGA!!!! Now!!!
@united you have failed so uncontrollably today that it's beyond repair. I'm beyond livid with your absolute disregard to operations.
@united A friend traveled via UA1470 today and never got their luggage. What recourse does the person have? Buy clothes and get reimbursed?
@united I keep getting kicked to an error message when trying to purchase a flight on http://t.co/p3N2w8JfpS. Have tried at least 4x.
@united you have a culture issue
@united rep wouldn't rebook. This is such a waste of time and poor communication
@united my flight is Late Flight due to mechanical issues 3 of 4 flights in past 10 days!
@united employees almost seem happy when delivery terrible customer service.
@united its 2015. How can my flight from a major city already be Cancelled Flightled 24 hours before departure due to weather??  Backup planes??
@united Been on hold on the phone for well over half an hour, waiting to make a reservation change I *wanted* to make online. Help!
@united 2/2 Instead, had to wait on plane from Ottawa that never came. Now I'm back home and have to try again tomorrow. Suitcase still lost
@united u Cancelled Flighted my flight from IAD to JAX. Was supposed to use plane from BNA but u used that plane for another destination instead. 1/2
@United appreciate the early arrival of UA1002, but any chance ORD will ever bring the bags out?
@united A broken luggage and a mild case of food poisoning from UA5 LHR-IAH. Who can I email about this?
@united friends been sitting in Houston since 7am flight Cancelled Flighted.Still don't have any answers. #BadCustomerService  #$10voucherwhatajoke
@united meant changed planes - i hate seating over wing if u wanted I would have booked it - u will get formal complaint
@united u guys did it again changed ages and double booked seats so I had to I've even though I have platinum and the other person none
@united haven’t before and haven’t this time &amp; have checked spam/junk mail just in case—nothing
@united sloppy stuff you don't see anymore - united has raised my expectations - this team was poor
@united no bag tagging, led to many people backing up the aisle to front with bags
@united cabin crew were huge offenders, stood as a conversational cluster blocking exiting passengers
@united allowing passengers on my flight to block exit of plane
@united no commitment to a good turnaround, an operations mgr would have counted a dozen small issues with individual performance
@united the nightmare continues... http://t.co/TsvgbrL15f
@united this team added 30 mins on turnaround
@united call wait times are over 20 minutes and airport wait times are longer
@united yes, I've been waiting for four hours and no one has been able to help me.
@united we are sitting on the runway for 2 hours! It is ridiculous!!
@united, no, your service here pretty much ruined my day, but thanks for the weak attempt
@united what, you forgot to tell them the flight was coming... Thanks for allowing me to miss my connection
@united Why was I forced to check my rollaboard on UA 715? Plenty of room in the overhead next to my seat. http://t.co/5xvNnmLTiW
@united. Please get me an economy plus seat. Awful day of 2 Cancelled Flighted flights, after lots of planning.
@united has me #stranded (weather NOT to blame). 1hr+ hold to speak to an agent that doesn't understand the concept of time zones, thanks!
@united but your system gave my seat away.now I'm 27L Economy! Not Econ + seat. How did you give my plus seat away?
@united please. You moved my seats and lost my upgrade. I had seat 20L. I have a ticket in my hand for 20L
@united any help is appreciated. That's a LOOONG wait for help on something that's not his fault
@united my husband is supposed to fly RDU to IAD then IAD to FRA leaving in 2 hours. You Cancelled Flighted his flight and there's a 1hr wait on phone
@united is probably the least satisfactory airline I've ever been on. Never fails to disappoint.
@united not sure why u call it customer care.  Should be customer we don't care
@united who is in charge of making decisions over there? Cancelled Flightling flight UA1150 was unacceptable. I should be in #Belize right now.
@united how about plowing the snow at a gate before the plane arrives so we don't sit for 45 minutes after an 8 hr flight.... Fail
@united ok so what is being done about my experience? My family had a terrible experience for $1,200. It's kind of like being robbed.Explain
@united great job losing one of my six bags on a direct flight.  Don't know how you manage to do it.
@united the worst customer service in Denver.
@united ruined my day &amp; start trip SFO to GIG. both legs changed, lost my paid upgrade &amp; 200 1st class seat &amp; moved me from Econ + to Econ
@united now been on board with no movement for 25 min...wow this experience just keeps getting worse and worse
@united have an employee at the gate 15min before boarding like u expect ur customers to. Be a competent company like ur rivals
@united No wonder the cabin is filthy. #badservice
@united And then when we asked the stewardess to take the disinfectant wipe as trash she said, ""not with my hands!"" #badservice
@united flight was Cancelled Flightled due to mechanical issues but when I ask for cab fare they say it was weather and can't help me
@united Luckily, I had my disinfectant wipes and did your job for you. You're welcome. #badservice
@united You really should clean the food and coffee stains off of the area around the seats when new passengers come aboard. Gross!
@united ROC flight Cancelled Flightled. Love my snowy drive home with no useful substitutes
@united that's a crazy long form! You need something other than a video?
@united I hope not to see the same issue on my return flight tomorrow
@united flight just Cancelled Flightled. This is ridiculous
@united appreciate getting put on hold for 20min and then getting hung up on because I was requesting help for big group. I'll try #Delta
@united thank you for your reply.  My frustration is that spending a upgrade just puts you on a wait  list.
@united @nathankillam or your staff could try not throwing the luggage around.
@united 4 of us are stranded   And flying from New Orleans to Huston tonight and we will be stuck there for two days. Rather fly than wait.
@united can't get anyone to deal with me in person. Cowardly customer service, I can't be looked in the eyes by anyone.
@united stuck in DC trying to get to Denver. The engine shut down twice on us at the terminal. Got any available flights for me?
@united yes 1427 Cancelled Flightled. Moved to 333. I'll figure out car rental changes and such.
@united terrible travel experience. Traveled 8000 miles roundtrip but two Cancelled Flightlations of short hops cost me two days
@united why are you charging people to see the freaking flight map? https://t.co/AgPb45v8wt
@United my flight from MCO has been delayed &amp; scheduled to arrive after my connection departs. What options do I have?
@united is not a company that values it's customer &amp; after reading tweets to them I'm not the only one who feels that way #lostmybusiness
@united I was insulted, disrespected and met with incompetence at every turn how about a voucher for a domestic round trip
@united. DAY to IAD and CVG to IAD both Cancelled Flightled by United but all other airlines operating. Friend stuck and now miss intl flight. Help?
@united well if you don't want your customers to be frustrated compensate them appropriately when you screw up royally!! #fakesincerity
@united employees are the angriest, angst-iest group of people anywhere (except for Tasha at check-in at IAH.) @dad_or_alive
@united But it's doubtful he'll fly United again and he will be traveling a lot as a sales manager covering all of North America
@united Worst customer non-service for sure!
@united Worst airline ever?
@united Just let the employees know that good service and a kind attitude towards customers is vital in this kind of business. Thanks
@United Right now at Tropic Air in San Pedro, #Belize. Line out the door. All due to elected &amp; appointed hacks http://t.co/kKEDjNRTWo”
@united Your new mileage policy is awful. Before, I might have paid slightly more for United because of miles. Now there's no difference.
@united yes refund my ticket and give me email address to let u know what happened
@united I would like 2 speak @United VP of #CustExp Jimmy Samartzis! I sent a survey/email about my awful flight exp http://t.co/OtFZ7CygUQ
@united Hello United. You should take care of your call center in Mexico City Office. Terrible attitude from the lady who was helping me.
@united Great!  I'm guessing you were Late Flight to open, service is horrible, you're overcharging, and don't care that everyone is miserable.
@united UNBELIEVABLY DISAPPOINTED. DELAY AFTER DELAY. STOP MESSING WITH MY LIFE.
@united What a really GREAT &amp; FLATTERING story about you! You should be very proud :) http://t.co/oKtUkjY92O (via @ParachuteGuy)
@united I interviewed yesterday as a flight attendant I was the last person the recruiter said they lost my file n came back to interview me
@united U BUMS HOW DO U LOSE THE BIGGEST BAG ON THE FLIGHT
@united customers ✅. Customer service ❌ http://t.co/qP6Aw3nLIP
@united great decision making skills flight ops IAH bag makes a 10 minute connection and I don't, flight pushed early. Disappointed!!!!
Meanwhile, they fucked my flight. @united: The festivities are already in full swing at the United Fairway Club, overlooking the 17th hole..
@united in the process of purchasing ticket, when prices changed. unbelievable. #RipOffs #PriceDiscrimination
@united 14 hours after landing in #ATL &amp; I still do not have my bags...which means no clothes or makeup!!! #UnitedAirlines #nothappy
@united #bullying in the #workforce not ok. Get gate agents 2 work as a team. 2 against 1 is never cool. #Delays #flights #UnitedAirlines
@united really fucked my day up Hilo to LAX 2hr30min delay because of software? missed connection, getting home 8hrs Late Flightr no upgrade nothin
@united send someone to the customer service counter in person. DIA concourse B across from gate B36a.
@united I'm not sure why I expected anyone to be here http://t.co/bnFlHPXtmw
@united this is not true. Gate agents 100% caused this. And we're not helpful. Thanks for making me miss connection!! http://t.co/xAIzW2isml
@united what's the hold up with flight 6475 from SLC to DEN??
@united DEN-PHX flight tomorrow Cancelled Flighted. Asked for overnight 2nite in LAX/SNA. Told not without paying. That's wrong
@united Yeah that didn't happen!
@united Why do I still not have my bags? They arrived @10AM &amp;website says they're still at the airport..2 1/2 hours Late Flightr???!! #nothappy
@United had a maintenance issue. Stuck in Geneva with meal voucher that won't even cover a pLate Flight of spaghetti. Really.
@united Hate when I get bumped out of the seat I've selected (&amp; empty row) and moved to another seat (non-empty). #1K #flt803 #nonupgrade!
@united no announcement re extra baggage, ""find an empty bin"" down to aisle 20 back up with baggage to my seat row 7. YOUR agents argueing
@united bags arrived - I sure miss the customer focused days when I used to fly @ContinentalAir1 Here's hoping @united wakes up
@united Total BS.have 1st class seats for connecting flight. Your crew Late Flight. We miss connection. Had next plane. Yet u don't honor it??
.@united too much info to share via tweet. Please send me your name and contact info. Happy to supply you with images and CS rep names.
@united once again your lack of customer service astounds me! You are the worst airline in the history of airlines! Train your staff!
@united Extremely disappointed in #Flight6831. United left crew and pssgrs stranded in rain @ gate with no cover. Left Psngrs 2 depart plane
@united besides landing the plane, overall customer service experience has been poor. Late Flight and rude workers plus missing luggage
fuck you, @united and your shitty fucking information http://t.co/scQUjbvsTA
@united on SFO-&gt;AUS UA343 2/17, IS9JX1; my seat appears to have had a mite problem. Dr recently confirmed over 50 bug bites were mites
@united customer service: 16hr delay coupon can only be redeemed on website which has $200 higher prices than Expedia, call wait time 55mins
@united I'm strongly considering taking my business elsewhere. #UnitedAirlines
@united really needs to start upgrading their planes. No TVs &amp; then the ""inflight wifi"" is currently unavailable #UnitedAirlines
@united I am not digging the new mileage earning plan. I would earn about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices?
@united outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first
@united Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? Website wasn't working.
@united bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything.  Long lines!! #ua1523
@united what's going on with the mileage plus accounts? Login through username and email have been down for at least three days.
@united what incentive do I have to give you another chance?
@united lost bag in Huston we leave for a Bahamas cruise today from #nola and had to buy all new stuff. Customer service is non existent
@United site errored out at last step of changing award. Now can't even pull up reservation. 60 minute wait time.  Thanks @United!
@united just had the worst customer service experience ever on united airlines
@united airlines 1st &amp; only time I ever fly your airline! What a disgrace. @JimTrotter_NFL I should've listened to your tweet! #HORRIBLE
@united diverged to Burlington, Vermont. This sucks.
@united officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure. There is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane!
@united 3 hours of sitting in the plane that hasn't left the Gate yet. 6 more hours of actual flying left.
@united I sent my details to the customer care link you sent me almost a month ago and no response.
@united terrible service for military members and their families. #ridiculous #UnitedAirlines
@united My flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm needing some help reFlight Booking Problems.
@united I was, just very surprised it took over 15 mins. Never experienced anything like that on 1K number
@united I'm afraid not... I fly or service every week and I'm just unhappy..spend too much money to be unhappy
@united if you're going to Cancelled Flight flights today, do everyone a favor and get on it now. Don't stall the inevitable.
@united your plane's been waiting at the Gate for two hours with all passengers onboard in their cramped seats. Yuck.
Flight UA1665 got delayed 2 hours due to a mechanical issue...could use a free drink or 3 to make up for this inconvenience
@united his cell phone record needs to be checked to see who did conversed with. I trust the FAA can handle this better.
@united 15.99 for wireless?  Was 6.99 epic #fail . #greedy #piggy you are the worst!
@united have you inspected the picture? routine aircraft check while on his cell phone? What will the FAA &amp; NYT say ? http://t.co/bNgpli8JT6
@united your ""Airserv"" contractors aren't worth a wet damn. 30min Late Flight, still not done w bags on UA1566. They made checkin a calamity.
@united Will never fly with you again! Terrible service!! Ruined our entire vacation!! #lostsuitcase #noreimbursement
@united web app won't let me upgrade seats, call center wait time is 20 minutes plus, just want to get more legroom but it's a pita
@united on flight 1665 but it's not departing! Website says delayed due to operational difficulties-what does that mean?
@united do you teach your gate agents 2 lie? Or do they just learn on their own? There was overhead space for my bag,  didn't have to check
@united i booked lh via ua.  However at gate they rebooked me to a Late Flightr lh flight.  Now that flight didnt earn pqd for me.  How do i get it
@united coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3)
@united It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM
@United terrible illogical re-route after Cancelled Flightled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual
@united never fails to have delayed flights 
@united Yes, myself and about 200 other people also.
@united is ridiculous! UA6 delayed for 3.5 hours and counting. Should have booked with a diff airline that takes it seriously #unitedsucks
@united at MSP w/3 employees trying to check in several hundred and the line is crazy might miss our plane be sure to thank these employees
@united my flight out of BGM Cancelled Flightled last night, I get a hotel voucher, but had to pay for a cab back. Worse cab experience ever
@united's first flight (4651, to #IAH) from #IAD is delayed...because no one hooked up ground power to the plane. Get it together, folks.
@united already missed connection... UA 495
@united typically once you get the problem fixed - then the crew expires - and the delay turns into a Cancelled Flight...
@united UA 1706 delayed again - I get charged $600 if Late Flight by you - you say ""oh well""
@united Friend stuck in bus on runway at PEK with two small kids no customer service, no explanation, kids crying, awful service.
@united no. U guys suck. I'll never fly with u again. And ur supervisors suck too.
@united yes there is when you keep getting the same robotic answer.
@united bad customer service  to NYC a few weeks ago. Thinking of moving on
@united @danahajek : United's CEO has decided to outsource and or push out more and more of their skilled and loyal employees..lack of staff
@united @danahajek : she means to say there has been so many complaints today (this week, this month) that she can't respond b/c she's alone
@united - you delayed our departure by 2 hrs to wait for passengers from another flight that was Late Flight! Unacceptable!!
@united flight 1136 from Chicago to Houston over 2 hours and no pretzels or peanuts?! Seriously about passed out.
@united - after having to now TAG MY OWN bags at the airport I was hoping they would actually arrive WITH me - here's hoping they arrive
@united so much for being here to help. Very disappointed in your customer service.
@united your system is down and after being on hold for over 20 mins -Mia tells me she is going to charge a Flight Booking Problems fee?! Customer service?
@united She  won't  be  at  my  wedding . This is an irreplaceable milestone. There's no reFlight Booking Problems. How can we be repaid for this?
@united Brothers luggage was lost on Copa Airlines Flight 635. He's competing Sunday for the 2015 Panamerican Cross Country Cup. Please help
@united On last flight of the day no less. I am now driving 4 hours to Aspen thru a snowstorm Thx to your teams lack of customer empathy
@united Yes there were PLENTY of seats available.  So why did Vicky Thomas refuse to give one to a million mile flyer?
@united funny, both my flights yesterday were delayed because of mechanical issues. Rotten luck to get 2 planes in a row with ""issues""...
@united waiting 12 mins and counting to get through to Global Services....something going on?
@united Also your at-gate monitor showed 23 empty seats
@united That is not what your reservations desk just told me.  They said there were plenty of seats
@united very exasperating I'm having a difficult time with Flight Booking Problems as the error message says you're undergoing maintenance. Really, now?
@united lax29108m make it happen please else on a cruise with no luggage tomorrow
@united no I did not make connection.  Your stellar employee Vicky Thomas refused to board me even though 23 empty seats on plane
@united no u don't
@united to Late Flight now, but in future flights, train staff better to handle emergency situations, and ground staff in Customer Service
@united Stuck in this airport 12 hours in standbys cuz the pilot showed up Late Flight in PJs &amp; i missed my connectin flight. PJ's I TELL U! #NYFW
@united if I wait I'll lose the flight. So frustrating.
@united it most certainly was not.
@united trying to book flight w/miles. Was on hold for 50m before I gave up. Need to get 6 on same flight using two diff # and pay 4 1tix
@united THAT'S the tweet u choose to answer, to tell me you're not liable?! #youretheworst #neveragain
@united y not? You're the reason we're in Houston and not NYC tonight. It took the plane an hour to take off - no explanations or sorry.
@united @airlines. Agents arguing about check bag announcement. Looked for room until seat 20, gave up and walked back to seat 7.Unnecessary
@united you should change your name to United Incompetence. No flight until Monday, have to take a 7 hour drive now to get to my flight!
@united not even mentioning how rude the customer service was to us. As a business owner, I'd be mortified if my employees acted as yours
@United has time to respond to everyone else's complaints but not mine. You just lost a customer
@united ""most likely"" makes it sound like you have no idea, which is not how I want my flights to be. Please use facts thanks.
@united tell me something I don't know...not #keepingit100 #weaktea
@united the wait time for a baggage question is 60 minutes that's crazy is there a limit to the amount of bags I can bring internationally
@united never flying with you guys ever again. The customer service is piss poor at best.
@united when a 2 hour flight turns into a 3:30 ordeal...sigh
@united where are our luggages? With a group and over 20 luggages are lost
@united assistance with what, the attitude of your staff no matter which airport we are at?
@united when will I hear? Guitar was damaged in December. I use my guitar to earn a living. Get your act together!
@united I was on hold for over 20 minutes and was talking to one of your employees. I asked him for name or id # and he hung up in my face!
@united I hope so but I've received no help so far. I've been on hold for more than an hour. Can someone speak to me?
@united tried other flight options as per weblink, non available for next 2 days, frustrating #notgoodenough #poorservice
@united how do you stay in business with such poor service? #poorservice #notgoodenough http://t.co/VO61LME5ja
@united or how about next time my bag is underweight you guys credit me $200. Or how about I take my business to an airline that cares.
@united It wasn't full, I had plenty of time to go to the gate and check, plus with my status I should have gotten on!?!
@united Then why did your staff refuse to let ME on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?!
@united Thanks for nothing. Next time I'll bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. That makes sense, right?
@united first you lost all my bags, now you Cancelled Flight my flight home. 30 min wait to talk to somebody #poorservice #notgoodenough
@united how is it that my flight #3367 can arrive early and be delayed due to no gate being available. We are now 20 min Late Flight on tarmac
@united my flight landed 50 min, but we are being told to stay on the plane, haven't pulled up to the gate &amp; have little to no information.
@united passengers seated, crew ready #WheresThePilot? Flt1088 from ORD. Hope he isn't at the bar.
@united you're right. Good you caught the mechanical failure. Too bad there are no blankets. But ok.
@united - we're sitting in UA1088 getting delayed because the operations can't find captain. #ridiculous #united
@united truly the WORST day of flying I have ever experienced...
@united Stuck in Houston because you can't seem to get a plane to the destination on time in perfect flying conditions.
@united you phone customer service team is bad. Think it is time for me to consider switching airlines.
@united how much longer United?? Been on the phone for over an hour to straighten out a star alliance upgrade!!! http://t.co/U1ViEuiDF5
@united I'm Cancelled Flighting my #mileageplus card and I will NEVER do business with you again. You clearly don't care about your customers.
Why even ask me to DM you and offer help if you ""can't do anything"" @united #terriblecustomerservice #unitedairlines http://t.co/feC4i3Vwq7
@united Yes and that is appreciated but misinformation damages credibility.  You may want to have someone observe in Newark #fwiw
@united you guys suck!
@united never fails, flying FC order ravioli get chicken. Tell the FA she says you should of told me, other people wanted chicken..idiot.
@united second time flying into Houston and 45+ mins waiting for luggage at baggage. Typical? Still waiting..
@united again HORRIBLE service, again attitude when asked for information, again you make me not want to fly UNITED ever. #platinummember
@united and now your rep just hung up on me after over 35 mins on hold because I asked for a supervisor. I'm furious right now.
@united thank you for 7 hrs at terminal D in Dulles airport http://t.co/IG2dgctt2M
@united go bankrupt again and transfer all of your assets to $LUV. That would be great.
@united Marcus helped me - good agent, couldn't fix it. Flight was listed on website, but ""unavailable""to book. False advertising much?
@united If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it?
@united not tonight, we got a hotel and after 14hrs of traveling and still not reaching our destination we are disappointed. Thanks
@united How can I file a claim when your agents won't let me speak to a supervisor? My claim number is expired because you WON'T find my bag
@united I have flown with you 10 times in the last 13 days. 8 out of 10 flights have been delayed. Huge mistake on my part. Don't fly united
@united yes but taking two days to get bag delivered. Missed a full day skiing because of this.
@united made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. Loyal flier for 10 years - time for change.
@united been sitting on this plane 3:15 unreal. When will my 2+ day nightmare end?
@united &amp; on top of no free tv on the int’l leg, now I’m sitting on the Tarmac in Houston, 70 min past departure w/ another hr plus to go
@united DTV doesnt work, pilots Late Flight, wont let 10yr old fly next 2 me and I paid 4 an upgrade. #unitedsucks
@united Your ""Loyalty Team"" basically flipped me off via phone, but thanks. Maybe Google ""loyalty"" and get back to me? ^LOL
Hey @united, this is your job, don't give me the safety spin. This is the same plane that broke on the original flight out. #unitedSucks
@united, if you mean beyond opaque ""maintenance issues"", yes, that would be  basic in customer service which your EWR staff can't manage.
. @united sad that you don't think it is important to resolve your client facing team that behaves disgraceful
@united Help! My girlfriend Amy Lloyd is going to miss our flt to Zurich bc of your fault. She needs a golf cart to meet her at ORD (1)
@united That was the problem.  We were being told the aircraft was on its way.
@united do you know how to use twitter bro?  Your terminal looks like it's in Bosnia.  Here's another pic. http://t.co/M9Nywr5Kbs
@united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible.
@united I took care of it myself. Had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. Due to united errors.
@united you may think I'm joking or blowing it out of proportion but the last 8 united flights have been delayed or significantly Late Flight.
@united not the case. Now delayed due to ""mechanical issues with no update on departure time"". Just Cancelled Flight the goddamn flight so I go delta
@united 2 days and 3 planes with mechanical issues?  Now over 1.5 hrs Late Flight sitting on this plane. This is insane!!
@united I didn't get a message from you. I'll resend numbers.
@United What idiot designed your seats? Armrest TV remote &amp; resting elbows don't mix. Seatmate keeps changing channels &amp; blasting volume.
@united Listen, learn &amp; do this: Remove your PQD requirement. It is insulting. ^HA
@united your agents forced me to check a carry on bag. When I received my bag I found your crew had stolen from me. U lost my business!
@united Really....you charge me $25 to check a bag and then you put it on a different flight....still Don't have my bag!!!
@united Why haven't you released a travel advisory for IAD for tomorrow????!!!!!!!!
@united cross country flight SFO&gt;BOS. No wifi, not even a can of soda and this quality inflight entertainment #sad http://t.co/xhlc30MTfF
@united is really getting horrible. So much for tucking in my kids tonight. Delta transfers miles/status, right? http://t.co/H6HN33JJJE
@united I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you'd like me to continue flying your airline.
@united roundtrip to London on @Delta ? I think I will! FYI that's another $1k you just lost. #moneynotspentonunited #unfriendlyskies
@united Don't ask me to be patient without offering something in return.
@united just like clockwork, Friday afternoon flights from LAS to DEN running Late Flight. Why does this seem to happen so consistently #KeepIt100
@united I will! On @AmericanAir @SouthwestAir @Delta or @JetBlue  all of which will be getting my business. #unfriendlyskies #unbelievable
@united incompetent/rude service today. Missed my connecting flight, then the customer service desk was terrible to me. Really upset w untd.
@united - terrible experience on UA415 on 17th. 1st exit row in economy has zero legroom. Have same row booked for return but can't change.
@united 5.5 hours Late Flightr I've been in transit for a total of twelve hours...please just change the plane on flight 600 this is ridiculous SFO
@united this delay of flight UA4636 has been painful. I sure hope it doesn't cause me or my luggage) to miss my UA82 flight to New Delhi!
@united worst AIRLINE 
BEWARE THEY DO NOT MAINTAIN THERE PLAIN 
BEEN ON THE RUNWAY THE PAST 4 HOURS!!!/
@united it should be free like other airlines! Again, it’s not 1997 anymore.
@united I know. I’m sure you hear it all the time — don’t like the new seats. I’m a small guy, 5’ 6” and I feel the new planes are tight
@united how about after 2.5 hrs at ORD another .5 on the tarmac + refuse to move me to an earlier flight you make it up to me? #iflyalot #bs
@united also doesn't help me. I'm a very frequent flier and united premiere gold. Apparently that means nothing.
@united delayed another hour
@united Can't beat the storm out of town if you wait to issue the policy until too Late Flight.  NWS issued storm warning already...
@united don't need your apologies, need my bag. Took 56 minutes from landing to get it. Unacceptable.
@united so we fly into SFO and Honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays.  I beg of you plz sort this out soon!
@United super lame that you charge $8 for tv on an international flight to the US. It isn’t 1997!
@united next time I will not volunteer to let you gate check my bag for space, since you obviously can't deliver it in a timely manner.
@united I'm sorry it's cold in chicago, but I don't see why that means it takes 45 minutes for my priority bag to show up on the carousel.
@united you are making me miss big snow in Montana. Not cool.
@united you might be the only airline not offering waivers...keep up the good fight
@united I know where to check. My complaint is my ticket said dinner when I booked now it's changed to refreshments. Where's my refund?
@united Bag MIA since Wednesday. Still no word where it is or if we'll ever see it again. #lostluggage #frustrated
@united we can't all be american airlines I suppose... http://t.co/0EWj7oKlji
@united Love to report how horrible this flight is to your team. Let's make it worse...as they get to my seat...out of all snacks
@United you need to get it together 3 of 4 flights Cancelled Flightled stranded with no car and my baggage is lost!  You NEVER get it right.
.@united It's worth saying that, if you litter in Singapore, you get caned. ""But there are rules"" says @united
@united why I won't check my carry on. Watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min http://t.co/lyoocx5mSH
@united why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always.
@united this means within one week i will have filed 2 compensation complaints to your website
@united Terribly disappointed. Confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alternate solution.
@united this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all.
@united its my one and only checked bag, which is checked to edinburgh, however i am being charged randomly from dc to newark
@united with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport
@united Thank U for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit, flight attendant indicated it wasn't cleaned properly.
@United I have never been so grossed out in my life. What a disappointment-yet again-flying with you.
@united thanks for delaying my flight for an hour, and then boarding us onto a flight that REEKS of vomit because it wasn't cleaned properly
@united I can't even look at you right now. I'll call you when I'm not so mad.
@united I requested an online refund option they denied saying the ticket was used, hope they understand the problem from your approach
@united yes it is partly used, the del-ewr is used, the return flight was Cancelled Flightled due to technical glitch in operations
.@united I appreciate you looking. Can you compensate me on anything for my troubles? Still haven't taken off for a 10:30 am flight
@united Another terrible experience with United. Discrimination. Delays. And no help from customer service #united #notimpressed
@united If a business decision is made that inconveniences and possibly causes lost customers, is it a good business decision? #Cranky
@united MIA-EWR #384  excellent crew. EWR-IAD #3589  No crew to load bags - waiting w/ door open freezing. 20 mins past departure.
@united your customer service is crap.
@united No. SATO rebooked me. Just upset that my travel office had to fix this, and you couldn't.
@united refreshes my browser right before checkout.error load message. Ticket price increased $358 in a matter of sec. DoUNotWantMyBusiness?
@united @JedediahBila Why is United voted every year as one of the worst airlines? Do enjoy that title? You should give Jedediah free passes
@united Thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken TV. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline.
@united Still waiting on our bag! Never got delivered yesterday. Can't reach a real person for help. Sending DM with ref number.
@united worst flight experience I've ever had. Will never ever fly your airline again.
@united why would a person take hours and hours of wait time just to tell a lie
@united hey! DM not working. UA 307!
@united the refund team is far from customer care courtesy they need training on work ethics. So it's like sir u r lying how can I help
@united splitting up my flights quadruples the price
@united contd... I am being told that I am asking for a refund on a used ticket on a flight that got Cancelled Flightled how is the ticket used?
@united after several trials and several hours of waiting on phone to contact customer care to get my refund all I get is cold shoulder
@united I booked and paid for a flight to get me to Denver at a specific time for a meeting. You failed... It wasn't caused by weather
@united what I don't understand isn't flight that I paid premium for getting Cancelled Flighted and the best you can do is next available flight...
@united Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can't use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous
@united I log in, view reservations, try view specific reservation &amp; takes me back to login page,
@united 3 times my flight has been delayed and I miss my next flight. This time you've lost my baggage. No clean clothes. $337 flight. Thx!
@united why the hell do my miles expire? Was really looking forward to accruing enough for a free flight in 10 years.
@united I'm familiar with the procedure. It wouldn't be the first time #UnitedAirlines lost one of my bags. #unhappytraveler
@united I get that. But doing it by giving inaccurate/misleading info doesn't seem like a great way to do it. #hopethegearmakesitintact
@united cleaning a regional jet takes an hour?
@united You just tried to charge $750 for a $539 flight when I tried to make a change over the phone, not including $200 change fee. WTF?
@united Flight 395. Rolling delay of 1 hour 42 minutes
@united your website is a complete joke when using safari!
@united the new seats on the Canadaair regional jets just plain suck.
@united airlines abuse your expensive video equipment and overcharge you for the privilege http://t.co/SdyLuKR7pt via @robthecameraman
@united that's the reply? Lol hoping that at least the new plane was maintained before the flight. 
@united Did somebody say flight upgrade?
@united I can tell you. Your airline has lost mine and my families business. 
This day and age message through Twitter travels fast.
@united this is very disappointing. This is about customer service.
@united boarded 6373 on time, deplaned, and now 100 minutes delay. No transparency during. Can't wait to give up my gold status for AA.
@united @44Stocker my wife Sarah stocker did also called but could not connect me to customer service
@united Once again I am victim to the scam that is your SHIT Customer Service, this time the agent hung up on me WTF do you teach your staff
@united flight 1219. My frustration boiled over after dealing with attendant. Her attitude was ridiculous.
@united nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. Free DirectTV for everyone! Ever hear of preventative maintenance?
@united that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and I can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help
@united obviously no one knows a darn thing around here.  What are we to do if this does not get resolved? http://t.co/Ph8QJzaPKx
@united I have those notifications yet the staff on board say that is not accurate and they have no departure time.
@united I'm not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I'm extra bloated.
@united DM sent.  This lack if customer service is getting ridiculous.
@united delayed going home AGAIN. Getting really tired of delays.
@united uh - I booked it through the UA website. Why the price change?
@united I'm rebooked. Getting home 4 hours Late Flightr then planned. What are the chances I'll ever see my bag again? #unhappytraveler
@united United Club team is A+ &amp; got me a seat Late Flightr. Still, not sure why a last min UAL Cancelled Flightlation costs me $ yet overbooked folks get $?
@united will flight 5559 to YYC be providing free food when we are allowed back on board  after the ""broken lightbulb""
@united I was not looking for the fare to be returned on the companion flight.  don't understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary.
@united Without baggage for 5 days and can't get an update from Houston airport since Monday. Worst service ever!
@united yes to three different checkers along the walk to the plane. Overkill
@united or I'm sure her business will go else where for airline travel. Her name is Kathryn Sotelo
@united made to check in my carry on from Flight 1449 PBI to Newark. Plane luggage stow not full. U r costing me time, money &amp; aggravation!
@united - please help regarding PNR A3ZZ0F. Why am I now waitlisted for a flight?
@united I hope you have a solution or insurance to cover this issue
@united customer service has no solution and now we might miss a show because of them
@united deserves to go bankrupt. Just delayed an outbound flight with no info on the connecting flight that we're going to miss
@united FLT 3444 delayed because of maintenance - that's fixed but can't board because flight crew didn't stay in boarding area #fail
@united not anymore.  Finally was ticketed 5 min before takeoff.  Not sure why the confusion with a full-fare GSA ticket.
@united yes, but they still don't know where it is.  I've been told it might be on a flight, but now no one can confirm it.
@United wind chill in Ithica -17 degrees, and for the trouble of losing my clothes they give me a t-shirt. I'll burn it for warmth. #united
@united I will be calling customer service. 2 delayed flights today now, luggage misplaced, a disaster across the board.
@united crew has been notified, passenger moved but water not fixed. Now on tarmac two hours
@united that link is not helpful as it does not put me In touch with management
@united Delayed CMH to ORD. Ran to gate 1 min b4 connection -door closed no one around. Ignored by 1st agent, 2nd super rude. #thanksunited
@united: Worse - headed to LaGuardia (delayed).  Why is the tray table the size of a mouse pad and the overhead the size on my pocket?
@united now 1558 from IAH to EWR has broken entertainment system and no WiFi despite info on app: http://t.co/FY6f9rZB9k
@united your customer service is terrible
@united please send help ASAP to @KathrynSotelo on flight 5957 to Chicago seat 9c #Airlines http://t.co/9sKrLyrZ1O
@united define ""appreciate"". I doubt the worst major airline in the USA acts on much feedback.
@united yea, a refund. Your airline ruined our trip.
@united that's wonderful. unfortunately doesn't help on this 4 hr flight between to major U.S. cities. #disappointed
@united thanks for delaying our flight for an hour, missing our connecting flight and terrible customer service. #neveragain #vacation
@united new flight has me at the window. Kind of ticked off. I pick aisle seats only because I hate window seats. #annoyed #EpicFail
@united is a money sucking airline with terrible terrible customer service
@united - are you aware your airbus fleet sucks?  I'd rather fly a C-130 full of rubber dog shit.
@united https://t.co/jpd7NsGRT7. Fyi your staff are telling customers to try other carriers
@united couldn't have possibly messed up our trip anymore than they did. Thanks for being such a terrible airline. #disappointed
@united no wifi on #ua688 #SF to #Chicago? 2015. That's all. Ps: This tech intro video is a joke. #EpicFail
@united no wifi on flight ua688. SF to ORD. Really?  Wow
@united is the worst http://t.co/27aitZl6nd
@united haha and you have to clean a plane that was held overnight in a hangar. Sounds lovely. Also don't lie on screensand say it's weather
@united no because you will charge me or delay me further. United 1612 still waiting.
@united I did and then she made me feel guilty because it was economy plus and I didn't pay for the extra leg room
@united #4781 Cancelled Flightled. #5102newflight I will be upset if this one Cancelled Flights too. I could have rented a car if they would have been honest.
@united Stuck in. ORD because United can't find their airplane. Lol. #upset terminal right now.
@united WTH be honest with your customers.  This better be the last change or we are driving home.  Has our plane left or not!
@united 2nd time in a row  I've been over charged by 100's of $$ on my plane ticket WHY? #united I shouldn't have to check my CC everytime
@united Is flight 5001 really going to leave Newark today?  If not tell us now and I will rent a car.  I do not want to end up stranded.
.@united thanks for the reply. I saw that but it's not particularly helpful to a hungry vegetarian not flying those specific flights. SHRUG.
@united so funny that my boarding pass said PRIORITY a because clearly I am not a priority to this airline
@united I'm sure you will offer me nothing for the inconvenience you have put me through TWICE this month. Tweets don't cut it
@united or you'll Cancelled Flight my flight like you just did
@united screwing me over twice in one month. Learned my lesson. We are through.
@united what's the point of offering a free checked bag of you lose it?
@united flight from vegas to houston Cancelled Flighted this morning ""due to operation"" what does this mean!???? Thank god I woke up early today!
@united education of that staff is needed - he also turned away other first class cabin passengers with mileage plus.
@united My guess:flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled because there are 16 empty seats and those who confirmed are not important. #frustrated
@united instead of making  seats smaller/thinner so u can jam more people on a flight,u should concentrate on maint &amp; happy customers
@united I need assistance with pulling your agents' heads out of their asses
@united gates were DEFINITELY NOT FULL. We were parked and wheels were chocked. Customer service called it an ""UNMET ARRIVAL""!!
@united I really have a hard time believing that 4 planes in this terminal are all delayed for mechanical issues. #whatgives #dullessucks
@United flight 4465 almost half an hour at the Tarmac ""waiting for papers""... Cannot miss my connection at IAH !
@united worst airline ever. Thanks for the slew of rude agents and staff making my delayed flights even worse.
@united no chance in hell. I'd rather walk. Worst airline ever.
@United is the worst major US airline.  More proof: they're boarding the plane with the outside galley door open in 0 degree weather.  Wtf?
@united Too Late Flight, damage has been done. Easily the worst airline experience of my life. Missed two connecting flights &amp; days of work. #UA49
@united don't know if you are aware that ALL of your premier access lines are closed in your terminal. I feel the love.
@united disappointed to learn you are now charging $200 to use 20k miles for upgrades on PS JFK flights. Will be looking at alternatives.
@united @FAANews unacceptable practice to leave Cancelled Flighted flight passengers to sleep on cement with no pillows #UA1724 http://t.co/nDTLJ15ZpU
@united Flight 6212...massive fail! They delaying to transport a crew member causing many to miss connections! Unreal!
@united I had the worst customer experience at Houston intl airport... Your ground support even for @staralliance members is a nightmare
@united I'm counting on you, please don't let me down! #delayed #again #needtocatchmynextflight #alreadyrebookedonce
@United why is it so impossible to actually get a passenger AND their luggage to their final destination?
@united #flightdelay on an early craft arrival because pilot is stuck in traffic #fail #nocustomerservice #nocompensation
@united  oh united, how much I despise thee!
@united your airline is the biggest joke of an operation in the world.
@united what is going on with baggage claim in Newark!#tiredandwanttogohome
@united usually your lounge staff are fantastic! Except today in MCO where almost denied entry to lounge even though traveling united-first
@united 2.5 hour delay, misplaced bag, poor communication, and the worse: unsympathetic, confrontational gate agent. Not cool!!!
@united Why don't you respond to my e-mails of facebook msg?! I'm still wating for my tickets!! I'm getting really angry and disappointed!
@united then send your Jeff Smisek on a trip with JetBlue or SW and make sure he takes notes. I would never choose to fly United again.
@united So disappointed in the service and the level of staff communication. Such a bummer.
@united to top it all off, your flight attendants talked loudly throug the flight, even when the lights were dimmed. Resulting in no sleep
@united it seems like no one from United can help me. Lots of fingers pointed, zero people stepping up. At least the gate has Oreos
@united they have access to the dial that makes it faster do they?
@united 1hr delay at the start, huge queues at security, no representative to meet us, rude staff at baggage reclaim  #inefficient
@united has the worst flight attendants. They are like those angry and drunk aunts that we all have. Everything has to be an argument.
@united its in black and white. EU law and all that €600 for a Cancelled Flightled flight. I want my money
@united accordingly? U dont respond at all
@united ""the extra care airline"". #unitedairlines they don't care. Trust me. There #customerservice is non existent. They don't have 1
@united Another unfortunate case of bad luck, usually maintenance issue. They are now swapping planes to ONT, will get in Late Flight. :(
@united it's a shame the great customer service wasn't continued in SFO. Slightly absurd
@united #onlyinAmerica. 18 days and not a word from #unitedairlines #customerservices. Bad PR guys.
@united still awaiting a reply from ur customer services?  18 days, no response? Lousy #unitedairlines
@united has happened on other airlines and they've given out flight vouchers and been more transparent about the problems.
@united agent Rick Clifton in SEA-HOU , told him my father is dying and needed to get my handbag on the cabin. he did nothing #shameful
we all watched as the crew was escorted from the back to 1st class. Prebooked? Really? @united: @JenniferWalshPR Your dissatisfaction is und
There were plenty of empty seats in coach ""@united: Your dissatisfaction is understood. Crew members traveling for duty are pre-booked on f""
@united your staff at LaGuardia and Lagos, Nigeria were unprofessional, uncaring and not helpful. Ou
@united U kept passengers waiting all night 4 a plane that was being put out of service.  Leaving everyone stranded for night. #inexcusable
@united Flt 359 lax to EWR. Your pilot bragged about getting to EWR early only to wait 20 min for a jetway driver. Thanks United!
@united I am so happy I found my phone because this is easily the worst system I have ever heard of
Really? 9+hours???? @united: @JenniferWalshPR We don't like delays and do all we can to avoid them. We'll have you on your way ASAP
@united @RobBogart After I waited hours in the airport being told one fib after the other. Why can't UAL be honest with its customers?
@united well. As of yet, our checked bag has already vanished and we haven't left the airport yet.
@united a rapid trip plane ticket from Idaho to California that doesn't have problems would be wonderful
.@united being delayed 3 hours for a one hour flight is more than frustrating. I'm also unable to get a decent meal at this hour.Never again
@united I would appreciate an answer on why we weren't alerted flight had been Cancelled Flighted until plane landed.  #showsomerespect
@united WTF!?!? Delay after delay. 15 hours YVR to SAN? Unacceptable. Flight Crew Availability is to blame? NEVER AGAIN with @united
@united hey, left my computer bag, w/computer inside, in United, filed online report, no response
@united here is my case id 8473573. Requested on 2/5, now it's 2/19... 7-10 days I'll get a response, BS!
@united I would like a supervisor to talk to. Now we are waiting for a flight attendant as one just walked off &amp; left http://t.co/IpaamZT7Z2
@united just curious, when are you going to to finally learn #customerservice ?
@united (1/2) thanks, but does not answer my question. I want to make a reservation over the phone in Perth, hold for 24hrs, and have family
@united it wasn't a delay so much as a straight Cancelled Flightlation. Weather wasn't an issue either.
@united thanks for ruining my wedding anniversary. Flight UA4904 from EWR to RDU is delayed by over 3 hours and will reach home the nxt day
@united Cancelled Flightled my flight for some unknown reason and haven't really given me anything to make my overnight layover tolerable
@united Yes my flight was rebooked. I'm just losing trust in you if I want to get anywhere on time.
@united I'm over you. Evry 1st flight I take w/ you is delayed &amp; evry 2nd is on time so its missed evry time. #lastflightofthenight #breakup
@united I did they did not.  I did submit a complaint on line and never heard back from that - I don't have that ID- you should find it
@United is freaking worthless. I hate this airline. http://t.co/dN1if2cGwE
@united not once did #US3645 leave #ORD on time this week #shameful
@united very missed daughter suppose to dpt ORD @5:59pm - dpted  8:30pm -checked week's average for UA3645 -shameful!  7 day average 7:54pm
@united fantastic night of waiting 3 hours for a delayed airplane, only for you to alert us flight is Cancelled Flighted when it lands. #whatstatus
@united they did on a delta flight out of LAX which is why I should be compensated for my rental car there.
@united I missed it. Set up in a hotel. Flights delayed in SFO for 6+ hours. Missing all the wedding festivities of my friend. 
.@united board customers onto a plane with no pilot? The only thing that expedited was my time in line to book a new flight. Come on now.
@united stuck on Tarmac for the last hour. Can I have a beer?
@united recent services have been very bad. My NC trip was aweful. Very disappointed and never again.
@united landed at 9:40pm and have been standing waiting for bags that were loaded plane side..why isn't the crew here#tiredcustomer
@united I was rebooked, however it would have been nice not to have to wait an extra 90 min at the airport.  How will you make this right?
@united enough already with the poor service, old planes, ridiculous routing. 1k and time to find a new airline with status match.
@united after waiting for over an hour we finally board the airplane only to find out we have to call maintenance. And this plane is cold.
@united broke my suitcase &amp; refuses to give me a repair estimate. http://t.co/zOUOwgv3Q6
@united How do you have a scheduled flight WITH NO CREW? Is there a competent person working at this airline?
@united can you help 689 in Chicago get to a gate. Freezing on a runway seems like a crappy thing to do at 9pm
@united thanks KP.  What's going on w/4840 tonight.  Bad update online and phone. Can't u give customers good info. Not waste their time?!
@united 4840 WTF! Why can't you update your times in a timely manner? You've known the fight was more delayed! Ur service is awful! @CNN
@united waiting on plane so long missed my connecting flight it left early. That's the last flight out tonight. HELP http://t.co/hBsJ2sF17h
@united ORD Gate C25 and Flt 619-  remember when customers were valuable? Is it so hard to be nice to someone lugging a guitar &amp; carryons ?
@united WORST SERVICE EVER. Denied access to our flight and then moved flight 6 times. How hard is it to schedule a gate? @Delta next time.
@united I'm in Denver, my bag is in San Jose. See something wrong here.
@united you know it's bad when you're praying your connecting flight is delayed because of an hour delay on the first flight #JustGetMeHome
@united playing hide and seek with the gate. ""We can't find it, it should only be a few more minutes.""
@united 5.5hrs Late Flightr and you still can't figure it out. Random text updates. #embarrassing #ua3728 http://t.co/vFTUyJh45X
@united stop picking on us #CLE http://t.co/VTqE8m1L3i
@united booked flight in sept to get best price for April to usa, checked now and they are €67 cheaper, what a con unhappy customer #ripoff
@united too big to properly manage flight times. There is such a thing as being on time. Or at least prepared with a gate when we land!
@united I'd rather have the truth about my flight than be forced to sit here all day. Trying to get home to this. http://t.co/U69fAfqhsF
@united another #DELAYED day. #Delayed outbound. #delayed inbound and now waiting at EWR for a gate to be ready. how is it not ready!??
@united Cancelled Flighted my mileage plus award reservation G6455C same day. Have yet to see my miles back despite agent confirmation.
@united 3 Gate changes in 30 minutes for flight to Roanoke and flight to sous falls in O'hare... Painful
@united this is nuts they said a flight was on the ground now it's still in Albany and they won't have a plane.  Someone is compensating me
@united Doumented via link. However, now that it has been over four months with no response, what do you suggest? Or shall I not expect one?
@united WHAT?! Y'all have zero concept of customer service. Oh...and now my connection is delayed too!
@united just changed again.  This is crazy! #YourAgentsHaveNoClue http://t.co/A37N3oHOKL
@united Never can get a flight out on time. 4 hour delay earlier another hour delay on my connecting flight. Makes 10 straight delays
@united b/c of your delay now you are oversold by 14 passengers?!??? This is a mess! What are you going to do to compensate?
@united - blamed weather lol 78 no wind and not a cloud in the sky!! Delayed both ways 4x!! RU kidding me to charge me for 1.5lb w/8 delays?
@united flight 4841...3 gate changes on top of this.  Really hoping you can compensate with some points/mileage to my account!
@united should contact me and the others on my flight who can't get their website to work. None of our info is valid! http://t.co/3zpJr7kWbk
@united over an hour stuck and still not off the plane. Total failure by you and your partners in ensuring the best customer experience.
@united silence is very telling
@united thanks for the 2hr delay and then no ground crew when we landed. At least you didn't break my http://t.co/GCWVFuopl2
@united Am I illiterate or is there a magic code to make your customer service site work? http://t.co/t4gcKs2bh5
@united worst airline ever! Staff is nasty, wifi down bags are delayed due to weather?? And now the belt is broken. Selling UAL stock in AM
@united I'm confused. After your @Dulles_Airport agents directed us to go to your website after DELAYS nothing works! http://t.co/cypRHe5GOK
@united 50 minute wait...still at the gate with a broken jetway. Might miss connection
@united Lost my wallet on flight 1007 yesterday from Houston to Bogota. Filled out your online form. No response yet.
@united I am now following you and see that I am not the only one experiencing and noticing a substantial downgrade in service post merger
@united 40+ minutes waiting at the gate for the broken jetway. Different gate maybe?
@united how can you never got a flight from austin to Houston in time for a connection ever? Ever!
@united now sitting on the tarmac for a half hour after landing because your jetway is broken. #2daysofunitedfailures #1thingafteranother
@united look at the Twitter history - as usual service non existent
@united make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more
@united How is this considered ""on time"" if it's arriving at destination half hour Late Flightr than scheduled? http://t.co/YMFTw1uyHr
@united thanks for trying to take my money without notice. In any other industry, you Cancelled Flight a service, a refund is issued. Cont…
@united And there is no direct phone number for status match desk? I really regret Flight Booking Problems with @united now.
@united yet again you disappoint. Sitting at IAD for UA3728 for 3.5hrs and you can't seem to know why the plane hasn't left Albany. #Fail
@united still sitting here waiting for a plane....4 hours wasted
@united line is just getting longer and moving slower. Lady working the counter is doing great, she just needs help. #customerservicefail
@united wasting time at baggage claim thanks to your dfw ground crew who checked my bag in without actually checking for space #frustrated
@united flight was too heavy so had to fly BACK to Palm Springs (after being in the air for 30 mins)
@united Your boarding process sucks. You should learn from @SouthwestAir
@united ouch, delays due to mechanical issues again QRO will have to wait! Yall seem to be falling apart #alwaysdelayed #unitedfail
@united my fingers are crossed that they are more capable of getting baggage from point A-&gt;B than United Airlines!
@united What happened this afternoon? Huge amt of incoming planes to SFO delayed over 1-2 hours.
Frustrating!
@united not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it's about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place
@united can you maybe have more than 1 person working customer service desk in Houston airport? Line 3 rows deep 1 person working
@united  Your survey is too long.  I fly a lot of segments and I'll fill it out after every trip, but not if it takes more than a minute.
@united can you you think about hiring some baggage attendants at EWR? Been waiting for bags for 1 hr. United = overcharged&amp;underserved
@united are you telling me that you are now Cancelled Flighting my flight ??
@united service staff to is less than friendly!
@united I am a comedian and I promise I will make fun of you on stage tonight.
@united tried to and got through the whole 2,000 characters and I was not even done.
@united you had us REBOARD without the captain.  So now we'll be sitting in here for another 20+ min? http://t.co/EEReKDf9Fq
@united On flight 1712 to Houston delayed duecto engine trouble. Willl you hold my connection to Argentina at Houston since I'm Late Flight now?
@united just delayed my flight to SLC by 2.5 hours. What gives? #snowforce
@united your airline is a joke. 1 person working special services at EWR?!? Line is 15 ppl deep. GROW UP!
@united More concerned that you close a club I paid alot for at 10.  Last flight 11:15p.  The construction going on is very inconvenient.
@united care less about the person - although he walked away while I was complaining.  A man at 10p at LAX club.  More.....
@united smiling? NOT!!
@united worst airline in the world-8 delays, gate agent loses her mind over 1.5 lbs and charges me $100 on top of the $25 I already paid!!
@united @bwood we'd prefer everyone hear our complaints amount your airline
@united worst airline ever after 70+ legs of travel I am officially done.  On time is not in their vocab.  I'm taking my premier status to A
@united I just want to contact someone with a question &amp; not be put on hold for 5 minutes in order to be hung up on or sent to the pet line
@united keeps delaying my flight, horrible customer service
@united You guys are atrocious.  Far better service as silver on Delta than you as a platinum.  I'll be switching back to delta.
@united I have and been denied! I called and got hung up on. Did speaks with manager on second call
@united Club DEN, East or West, both are disgusting. http://t.co/XijYrPsLZK
@united installed and working are not the same. Kicked me out after an hour and wouldn't let me back in. Four wasted hours.
@united that's what I tried to do, but when entering email into 2nd device made email typo. No way to fix it &amp; no option to log out/in!!!
@united so the 4-6hrs that you told me was what? A guess?? They've apparently had the bag 20hrs now and no call.
@united still waiting 4 our bags. Web STILL can't tell me its location . How come @UPS @FedEx can tell u at any given minute where it is?
@united seriously? After waiting 2 hours on the plane for my 10:20 flight to leave at 3pm I have to leave the plane? Great. Just great.
@united ""We like hearing from you."" So why haven't you replied to my tweet and/or email yet? https://t.co/caf2cx3gfi
@united Rude grouchy agent at Dulles check-in just got my 19 hour trip off to a lousy start. He needs a nap or something.
@united 1k use to be special.  80 people in group one.   Why not board global AND 1k together? http://t.co/qd2lyUXAZg
@united thats because you didnt read my entire tweet. Wife's 12pm flight is now delayed to 6:30.  Thats 3 6+ hour flight delays in 2 weeks
@united I'm not as sure as you are. http://t.co/HSMpbSF4UF
@united how does that help me with my customers that I couldn't meet with (and subsequently lost)?
@united question - was given food vouchers but can't use on plane..how   come
@united needs to pay for my car. I could have been on my flight if 4 help desks did not say it already left. Shame.
@united Bos-SF was in between waivers. Business Cancelled Flighted due to weather before/after. No flexibility/compassion in extreme circumstances = 
@united I see you tweeting as little as 7 min ago. Are you just ignoring my CS request? #CantLogOutOfUnitedWifi
@united anyone awake? Paying for wifi on iPhone when need to be using it on laptop. Logout option for wifi in flight? Time is wasting!
@united I work in customer support- extremely saddened United won't waive change fee for flights I had to Cancelled Flight due to east coast storms.
@united ANOTHER F*CKING DELAY IN THE PAST 32 HOURS!?
@united 777 from SFO to HNL with ZERO entertainment systems???!!!#youareonyourown
@united flight UA5631 from SFO to Burbank has been delayed twice now. Still no plane in sight. Get it together.
@united Just saying the truth. You don't even an email! #2015
@united MR, she's on her way now, but thought id detail the extravaganza for you... #dobetter #please http://t.co/V8PVpHMtZc
@united we followed the baggage rules on your website and was still charges $150. But only going one way
@united Need to track lost luggage being shipped to me. Need ph # for human. Not automated 800-335-2247.
@united nonrefundable, hence I wrote $200! Doesn't make sense for my 150 credit. #nothanks
@united your website was down all day yesterday- tried 3x put all info in&amp;didnt go thru- today the flight I bought went up!
@united you do realize my wife is waiting on a delayed flight at this very moment.  I'm not sure I understand your tweet.
@united I'm a minor and freaking out bc I might not make my connecting flight to Hawaii so yes I'm frustrated
@united I have been denied. Not sure how you charge $150 one way then $25 on way hime
@united even so, change could not be made  online- instructed to call an agent- maybe the syastem should allow agents 2 link passengers!
@united Case ID 8544484
@united your Airbus a320 seats are awful. They don't recline.
@united to DM you I have to follow you and I'm not doing that. Plus they're no more options. That's why I had to fly with you. #epicfail
@united - why am I sitting on this plane for an hour after scheduled takeoff without a cloud in the sky? #keepusguessing #isthisyourfirsttry
@united of the airplane otherwise they would call the Police, because the flight had to take off before 12h30am
@united @perfectomobile huh?  I have sent 16 crash reports in Feb alone.  8 in one day.  Only app I have that consistently crashes.
@united I was abused , threatened and forced to travel in a lower cabine (last seat) in yesterday's flight from Houston to Sao Paulo
@united Contacted yesterday and was told that there's nothing they can do - they suggested I email for some compensation ??? cust service???
@united unfortunately, that doesn't help. Just an automated computer.
@united airlines delayed our flight on the way to Chicago and leaving Chicago. Next time @Delta it is.
@united They inquire and then do nothing about it...pretend they’re interested. Responded to your DM and no response back...
@united I must stop my relationship with you. You've become greedy and heartless and our long term relationship is over
@united your customer service is lacking and you owe me a @GoPro camera. I also appreciate not being interrupted every time I speak Thanks
@united Can i get a refund? I would like to book on a better airline.
@united whom can I call to discuss - as I was told that united has no phone contact with passengers  - this is absurd...
@united messaged you as requested- and called your baggage team again. It's STILL in Newark. please help or let me know next steps!!
@united Flight delayed 40 minutes in ORD because plane didn’t have all the food. That should be fixed in the future. It’s a dumb delay.
@united need to chat with an actual human ASAP!
@united 3/10 disappointed in the service. Will be missing my connection after over an hour delay + cramped seats. At least their app is good
@united what a joke. Hang up on customers!!
@united Over charged me one way for baggage.find out others leaving Pittsburgh with same equipment weren't charged Just hung up on me!!
@united So publicly you asked for details on my flt. Sent you a DM, like you asked, and have yet (2 days) to hear from you. #unitedfail
@united can you help from there? UA4935 can't take off without missing galley cart that no one can find. Pax all seated for last hour.
@united That doesn’t make any sense. I’ve been 1K for over 5 years, and you’re making it harder to keep me loyal.
@united the Premier desk was able to rebook me with our friends at @AmericanAir. Only problem is now I have to pay for a checked bag :/
@united I did, and as I thought, nothing happened
@united the flt TO ORD is correct.  Per my DM- it is the flight from ORD to CVG I was charged for incorrectly
@united You need to change the way customer service is handled! I have been waiting for a supervisor to contact me for 17 days, what gives?
@united I need to talk with an actual person about missing luggage. Please advise on how to make that happen.
@united I know I can see that too but now estimated time of dep. is 10am. I don't understand why there wasn't a better estimate 3 hrs ago
@united ""where we trick you into making us look popular on Twitter by being the worst airline"" #wellplayed #jokesonus
@united that's what I have been told. But refund doesn't really makeup for the inconvenience caused and the missed meeting... Does it?
@united please explain why I need to pay bag fees twice, equally $1200, because a delayed flight resulted in bags being rechecked overnight?
@united - watched the entire #UNCvsDUKE game on the Tarmac before Cancelled Flighting my flight because crew timed out, right before my 4hr flight....
@united - vacation days: relevant, Ritz in PR for the night: $700, losing a day to idiots and sleeping at the Newark ramada; #priceless
@united - That time when I spent a night trying to sleep in a toddler bed at the airport Ramada without my luggage you kidnapped #furious
@united I am calling to check on a future flight and your first agent hung up and now you sent me to the pet travel line!! This is HELL!!
@united fyi the site/app still shows plenty of the unavailable flights I had errors with. Almost 24 hrs after sellout. Flying @AmericanAir
@united sure... You've been saying that for as long as I've been tweeting about your obsolete fleet.  Promises are free.
@united i will never be flying with #UnitedAirlines ever again. $285 for checked bags? All under 50lbs? #angrycustomer #unitedairlinessuck
@united The flight turned around for mechanical reasons on 1/30/15.  Never to fly United again as they don't check their planes properly.
.@united you should really have that addressed somewhere on the website, find that completely irritating &amp; am unable to take my flight now.
@united UA1740. 4.5 hr mechanical delay all I get is $50 voucher? Will tweet when I book next trip not on UA.
@united hi.I am still waiting for the refund. This is ridiculous.Or u approve my tickets or u give me a refund.Please advise wht is going on
@united booked a flight yesterday, appeared in my account + confirm email but since a few hours all disappeared and err ""no segment in this""
@united no- we are boarding- but why can't your agents, on the phone, taking care of 1K travellers, link reservations?!?!!
@united EWR ppl told me to call 1800#, have 2x/day since Monday. Still at layover loc. have that ref # tho. Any help appreciated.
@united you board a 630a flight and then Cancelled Flight it because it doesn't have a pilot?  Now I miss my meeting Atlanta because someone slept in?
@united no response 3 weeks since complaint submitted and 3 days since you all said you would look into it
@united worried the cold weather or snow would delay us this morning, but no it was the pilots. #stillwaiting
@united rushed through the -6 degree weather to get to the airport on time. Too bad the pilots didn't do the same. #stillwaiting.
@united - handed a slip of paper,&amp;said to call 1800#. Have called 2x/day trying to get it sent, still @ layover airport.Have that ref # tho.
@united to recap, you bounced me off my flight, LIED TO ME, then hung up on me. What am I supposed to think/do now?
@united ...she said she would need to get a supervisor. While waiting for the supervisor she hung up on me.
@united ...she could not access seat map so she said she would note the upgrade in my itinerary and to call back Late Flightr...
@united loses my luggage and @hotelstonight loses my reservation. after a 10 hour travel day. I just want to get to @StartingBloc in the am!
@united oh flight was fine. my lost luggage? not so much. looks like I'll be at least a half day Late Flight to my conference in Santa Monica...
@united 8h flight without a working screen for me and my friend and not possible to move to another place #unitedfails#worsttripofmylife
@united ^GJ flight 1101 didn't have wifi even though it was promised to by your ground crew. #AnotherDisappointment
@united ^GJ I will. You have to agree that 7+ hours Late Flight for arrival is unacceptable. I only hope and pray my bag is here.
@united : Unhappy with United's service?
Read Ralph Nader's open letter to UAL's CEO.
Leave a comment or RT.
http://t.co/O0745APIau
@united the best seats should be for paying customers and we should get to board first #badcustomerservice
@united this happens all the time.  United pilots are always in the exit row.  America treats there customers better than their employees.
@united yes when I got to the gate I specifically asked if there where any other seats.  Very discouraging to walk past the crew. 37d
@united unavailable leg that registered hours after being sold out. Only option to offer after 45min was +$400/ticket or Travelocity (2of2)
@united error message said couldn't process request at the last step after seat selection on each leg. Agent was unaware of an (1 of 2)
@united  4348 soon going to have more wait time for a gate, in empty MSP airport than it was in flight  50 min and still counting...
@united ... horrible wait time on 4348 to get a gate  ..shows total miss  management . Value customer time and respect thier sentiment
@united  very disappointed by the service starting from gate operator at BOS , who was  rude in stopping a carry-on bag...
@united your service sucks to Mexico from houston. You finally realized that snacks in1st don't work you cheap as);:
@united ^GJ I do believe that this is hands down the worst service I've EVER experienced. Makes @comcast look amazing. #UnitedAirlines
@united UA5029 from RIC, UA507 from ORD, &amp; UA423 from DEN -ALL DELAYED for non-weather issues. Way to go, youre batting 1.000! But no hotels
@united I would have made it if you hadn't already booked me on another flight and Cancelled Flighted my original reservation.
@united @staralliance how can I book reward travel in August?? Everything is blacked out.
@united because of the horrific flight experience, you guys have made me NEVER want to fly on an airplane every again!!!!!!!
@united My flying United is over...sorry. The Captain still had 20 minutes of pre-flight preparations to make while we sat with no air!
@united I was only trying to get my emails. What are you talking about? What most business people expect from airline wifi
@united it's not there we tried. It's already here in cancun just no one has delivered it
@united what you did was illegal and a breach of contract. I will be in touch but not through your ""customer feedback""
@united its not the way to treat your customers we had a lot of issues and it was not worth our headache we went thru
@united yes we are in EWR and it was corrected but just the fact the it was beought up for us to share rooms is unexpactable
@united please review and fix your baggage procedures at Dulles because it happens every week when my sister travels there on your airline
@united nothing else from you ^GJ? Where is your customer service?
@united oh no, I'm rebooked, 7+ hours after my original arrival time. We can talk compensation.
@united my coworker that had the same conflict as me with the hotel issue trying to share posted on their facebook page and they erased it!!
@united lost my parents luggage to cancun, said it would be delivered to hotel by 7PM, it is now almost 11PM
@united then watched my connecting flight in DEN pull away from the gate only to pull into THE SAME gate. #SlapInTheFace
@united @christinebpc ...and on some versions of the 738, row 11 has no window at all. Go ahead, check. We'll wait.
@United I'm pretty sure I've got shin splits from SPRINTING through IAH only to watch my plane pull away from the jet way...
@united well the income flight to dca to take us to ewr was delayed and it made us miss our connection to FLL so yes hotels were necessary
@united can you please stop Cancelled Flightling your flights? I am trying to get home to take two exams tomorrow. You've Cancelled Flightled 3 flights on me.
@united &amp; I've been hung up on twice by your staff. So upset right now
@united 2 hour flight from FLL to Ewr, 1242, now waiting 1 hour plus for bags, no sign yet. What gives????
@united was such a better airline when you were Continental. $75 service fee + $75 Flight Booking Problems fee + $25 talk to a human fee: FU!!!
@united this is despicable I spoke to  many diff people &amp; everyone is telling me something different I have a claim no. I need my bag now
@united how come the crew traveling on the flight gets a better seat and I get stuck checking my bag and the crews bag got on the flight.
@united you can't claim ""weather"" with your hardworking crew pulling seats out of a plane! Do the right thing. But we both know you won't
@united you're missin the point! There was no ""weather"". You're lying! Seats was broken. But u claim ""weather"" to get out of hotels. Classy
@united are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year?
@united this is not what captain said! Your 820pm flight to San Francisco is delayed due to weather. UA1416 now departs ....#failagain
@united I bet @SouthwestAir doesn't turn a thirty minute delay on an original flight into a 7+ hour delayed arrive time
@united. Worst flying experiences ever the past three days. Your airline needs to get it together. Lost a customer with me
@united #CustomerService #fail long time flyer switching airlines #frustrated
@united negative. Done wasting time with amateurs at customer service. Thanks for at least offering.
@united can you DM me? Been on hold with customer service very long time (53 min +) and getting the run-around. Thanks.
@United OMG WHERE IS MY BAG??? YYZUA70435 - enough with the shenanigans already. It's getting real old real quick!!
@united is the worst airline. Lost my luggage delayed my flights and has been very unaccomidating
@united I mean is there a real live person somewhere I can go and speak to at Newark post security?
@united Apologize to the President. Once those employees blamed him, I heard it repeated 20 times.
@united A change fee of $200. Same exact flight from ATL-HOU is $165. Why a charge of $574? The math doesn't add up.
@united hello. I'm overseas &amp; my bag is lost. I can't call customer service but can you help me?
@united I knew I should've flew @VirginAmerica lol
@united, UA1641 EWR-MCO 17 Feb wifi never connected but allowed me to purchase access twice &amp; charged me. Who do I need to file claim with?
@united My feedback and concerns via your site aren’t going to improve my poor airport experiences.
@united just dropped bags at Newark. Your desk guy was the rudest customer facing person I have met. Even my two children were shocked!
@united well sorta....we r trying to get to Aquadilla, PR but only 1 flight goes there a day. All are booked. UA Cancelled Flighted our flight to NJ
@united why does it cost $547 to change the city of origin when the same flight on http://t.co/8FMZZOltv9 costs $165 #customerservicefail
@united, I'm still frustrated I gave up my seat &amp; the promised Travel Certificate was withheld w/o explanation. http://t.co/KvfwajVViD
@united Not sure what happened @ MSP yesterday, but VERY UNHAPPY my bag was not only delayed, but sat at MSP for 8 hrs b4 delivery @ 2:30 am
@united it's almost like we're punished for living near a large metro area. EWR was top ranked for domestic delays. Not good
@united thanks. Weather is understandable, but when every single domestic flight is delayed because of inbound int'l flights, it's crazy
@united no tag number. Luggage was taken off the weigh scale and appears to have been sent off on conveyor belt without any tag...
@united correct date is 2/11/15!
@united 3 phone reps. None could see I was rebooked so missed that flight.Told to go standby for a nonexistent Late Flightr flight. Did I hurt you?
@united can't DM, you're not following. LLY144. Rebooked on #UA1516 but still need seats.
@united the supervisor on situation- Stacey took all our details-no claim number given to us
@united 1 hour since boarding began and we're still sitting at the gate.  #UA507
@united Tks for reply. PSP employees blamed Late Flight departure on POTUS when main reasons were DVR flt Late Flight &amp; insufficient ground crew to handle
@united took this one just for you. Not a window. Also not fun if you get motion sick. http://t.co/m81rV0blxs
@united #1007 Houston-Bogota with an engine problem, mechanics trying to ""fix"" the problem, safety first, better to change the plane
@united you have yourselves to blame for giving me the time to get drunk and tell you how I feel about your overpriced sub par airline
@united idea: if u don't want us to be frustrated don't Cancelled Flight flights because your crew overflowed a toilet. Get a plumber
@united I will be patient in my luxurious middle seat on my next delayed flight
@united be patient while I let this string of tweets go out showing people you are bad at your business
@united I think you guys had a half full flight at 4 so you held our overbooked 3pm flight to fill the other one then Cancelled Flightled mine
@united thanks I'll fill out the form that no one reads or responds to.
@united I was patient when they refused to switch my flight Bc of my checked bag then Cancelled Flightled the one I was on
@united   sent DM last week, re: suit regarding your error. No response was given. Please Answer DM or tell me who to send suit to....
@united I wrote to you but got nothing.and I am out of US .It is very simple thing.Will ypu provide compensation for your delay?
“@united: @qlyss8 We don't want our customers to be frustrated. Thank you for your patience. ^JT” A lovely sentiment, but not a $180 one.
@united 4 different departure / arrival updates for UA304??? In 1hr. Please!
@united #vegan meals can be more creative than noodles, peas, and zukes. Non-vegan yogurt is not acceptable for a vegan. Can you do better?
I will, if you can show me where this new program is beneficial to your longstanding loyal consumers... @united
@united all i hear is blah blah blah ....you shoulda used that $400 to buy a @burningman ticket instead. &amp; ill be driving there not flying
@united thanks for not letting me switch flights Bc I had a checked bag then Cancelled Flighting my flight forcing me to take another 3 hrs Late Flightr!
@united just informed you don't reimburse for issues due to weather. this is why your flights keep getting Cancelled Flightled--Thor hates you
@united Midland couldn't get our bags to connect on our Intl flight to Sydney, so have to get em in LA &amp; check em in there.
@united this may be the last time I fly your airline.
@united Is your company motto: ""I do not care!!!""  I heard several times from your employees to your clients in the past week.""  #idonotcare
@united you should tell that to the staff at LAX then. I boarded group 5 at the very end of the queue as a Gold member. Thanks for nothing.
@united Missing crew, passenger doc problems, frozen toilets, and now we're off the plane. Give me my money back.  UA3466
@united there was 20 min to departure, no one waiting. On being pressed ground staffer threatened ""do you want to get to SF today"" #fail
@united flying lax to Sfo and system won't let me check in. Your site tells me to do it through @AirCanada and they tell me through you.
@united sure but the plane is an hour Late Flight! Your ontime departure ship sailed away a long time back!
@united UA6002 MLI-&gt;DEN. Will miss connection UA3530 DEN-&gt;YEG due to delay.
@united How come you are the ONLY airline, of 90+ flights last year that makes me check my carry-on. Not even gate check...baggage claim?!?
@united I had to change airports to actually get a flight out when my flight from FAY was Cancelled Flightled twice. $180 taxi ride to RDU--reimburse?
@united yes of course I have.  Is this how you treat customer with no recourse?
@united Can someone assist me with my DM's? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter.
@united Flight was overbooked! Was offered voucher to wait &amp; take another flight. Gate agent switched me over, retracted voucher offer.
@united As a Million Miler I've been delayed plenty. NEVER in the amateurish way@SilverAirwsys does it. I'd be embarrassed to be affiliated.
@united airlines claims to have a low fare guarantee, but they won't honor a lower fare that I found.
@united Another delayed United flight. I should not be this surprised or upset. I'm mostly disappointed I have to Cancelled Flight my trip with my dad
@united still can't dm, it's LH7631 on 21/2/15
@united, I booked our flights w/ @WestJet. I saw the same prices each time I searched. It wasn't the least bit frustrating. #customerservice
@united my cats flight was delayed 1+hour  she will be arriving to Hawaii after 5 &amp; I won't be able to pick her up until tomorrow 
@united now you've lost my bags too.  At least nobody has done anything to help out.  This is absurd.
@united What's up with the reduction in E+ on 737-900s? 1K who can no longer confirm E+.  Forget upgrades - just want legroom. #unitedfail
@united offered me a voucher to switch flights. Now voucher offer doesn’t exist &amp; the gate agent switched me to a delayed flight!
@united I usually like flying with you guys but $200 fee to use my credit seems ridiculous #notcool #exhorbitantfees
@united Thanks, but not so much the missing bag as the nonexistent staff at this apparent remote outpost (busy airport for city of ~1M).
@united Just boarded UA1297, was refused from carrying overhead bag as no space, in plane now with loads of space #fail #customerexperience
@united get your act right! You just lost customers because your staff wouldn't let us take our approved carry-on on a half empty flight!
@united Held up for almost 45 minutes and then promised free movies and it didn't work and neither did the wifi that was paid for. Boo :(
@united Nice ""partners"" you have. The delays keep increasing every 20 min @FtLauderdaleSun @orlandosentinel http://t.co/1AtEafnC6R
@united UA1740 just admit you have no clue when flight will leave Denver. #unfriendlyskies
@united Just had the worst experience ever flying with you
@United UA1740. As the inbound flight dep time gets closer you push it back 15 min. You've been doing this for 2 hrs.
@united why is my flight from mke to ord getting delayed? Our gate attendant is not communicating!
@united my plane sounds like  a DJ  scratching is this normal? If so, will this eventually be a new entertainment fee.
@united how can i trust United with future Flight Booking Problemss when a confirmed, ticketed and purchased ticket is Cancelled Flightled after the fact?
@united rebooked.  This one is Late Flight too.
@united 2nd Late Flight flight today
@united 3586 from IAD to BUF.  Incredibly loud, and like a third world 70s inner city metro bus.  #lowstandards http://t.co/m67WnBglXQ
@united your overall experience of flying is not friendly
@united a good start would be  to warm the plane before the departure time so the flight isn't delayed due to frozen water lines.
@united annnnddddd I'm going to lose my first class seat on the flight they shuffle me to
@united 6 hour mechanical delay...killing me
@united every time I check a bag with your airline I'm confident I will be wearing the same clothes for 3 days.  Please prove me wrong.
@united. Thanks United for the no running water and Late Flight flight from Grand Rapids to Denver
@united KN: not allowing me to bypass the receipt # on the refund request form. Never received receipt email. charged http://t.co/Cju102xP2k
@united When will that happen? It really confuses when the 1st content to come on the 6in screens is about how technology forward United is.
@united you mean like my mailing address and rate? By the surliness of my United ""coworkers"" I'm guessing our benefits aren't great.
@united I already sent feedback and your reps are who told me about the priority. I'm speechless at your system
@united just because you are a monopoly in @flySFO doesn't mean you treat your frequent fliers like crap.
@united Yeah, bag is on the way. As per usual.  I'm actually getting used to getting it delivered to me, its kind of nice in a sense.
@united Why does it take 4-6 weeks for a new MileagePlus Premier card to be sent out? #stillwaiting #doesntfeellikestatusyet
@United Wonder why people hate dealing with airlines?  Ridiculous and inflexible ""policies"".  I need a phone number and a resolution.  Now.
@united (2/2) It suggests that if can't confirm cert at time of Flight Booking Problems, I should assume that it may never clear. Didn't used to be that way
2/2 @united You don't really care about our comfort, you care about profitability. That's fine, just own up to it. #unfriendlyskies
@united missing this wedding because of these delays would not be cool
@united Designed to deter people from forgetting things or to provide more storage space? The article says the latter #unfriendlyskies
@united what do you think missing meetings is worth?  A flight voucher?  I fly all the time, so what would make it right?
@united its ridic you cant transfer credit, you have my $400 &amp; youre taking $200 of it for Cancelled Flightling. Atleast let me keep the credit damn
@united - with airport self checkin your only option I'm now your employee. Training was a bitch. Send my paycheck asap.
@united the lack of customer service is astounding https://t.co/72RMpkOGwu #2daysofhell
@united my bag is a few days Late Flight to me and this is like the 3rd time in the past couple months.  Where my free miles at?!
@united of course but they were just as helpless as everyone else .
@united another week has passed and I hoped that I would have had a response by now
@united there's no reason it should take 7-10 days to respond.
@united yes, I know that. The question is ""why is that still the case""? #fail
@united There are Exit-Row window shades in approx 11% of the windows  of your RJ-145s. &lt;--a frequent flyer http://t.co/aOEaeszDLX
@united There is no excuse for leaving a minor to spend the night sobbing (9 hours) in a plastic chair. UA's actions? Terrible. # united
@united My wife and I will be sharing this dreadful experience. Don't pretend UA cares about young girl traveling alone # United Airlines
@united JH: going to process my refund for wifi. its asking for a receipt #? I never received an email- you guys just whacked my credit card
.@united Don't post a link to an article that verifies the initial complaint with 20+ comments saying the same thing. @harris
.@united Will breaking them in somehow make them longer so that they don't cut off the circulation in my legs? #unfriendlyskies
@united worst agents in US at Ft. Lauderdale Airport; passengers stand in line, getting status alerts &amp; still didn't make an announcement
@united This is with regard to a flight from a couple weeks ago. I'm very frustrated with your policies &amp; expressing that.
@united thanks for reaching out. The seat was hard, not enough cushion. OK for short flight. BTW, UA6465 flight and crew were great!
@united surprise me.  Otherwise, the flight is over and I don't have a good feeling about your airline.
@united we have been told that it's lost...you guys don't know where it is
@united Disappointed,UNITED did NOT feed small CHILDREN on a 5 &amp; half hour flight (Honolulu to Los Angeles), Appalling, ESP food waspaid for
@united Filled out at the airport as part of a long day made longer.
@united UA6255 delayed out of #winnipeg because the plane was ""frozen""! #fail Will I make my connection on UA1059? #tightconnection #Denver
. @united you know your updates every 6 hours telling me you don't know where my bags are is also equally irritating. #ColtsMissingBags
@united 1627 to Montego Bay going back to gate bc 1person was Late Flight? Awful service for all of who came on time!!
@united in other words... sorry, not sorry.  Plenty of other airlines... and I travel A LOT.
@united delayed agAin by United. Gate agent was borderline rude when I asked her a flight status question. What is happening to United?
@united just give up.  Your service is terrible.  If I wasn't forced to use United on certain routes, I never would.
@united I'm checked in, agent wouldn't tag my bags at 7am. Now I'm standing in line hell.
@united this is getting ridiculous. Now we're missing our connection.
@united Couldn't use the confirmed upgd cert you gave me b/c you decided to sell anyone a biz seat for $299. Why do you bother giving them?
@united any chance you can troubleshoot check ins at @FlyYOW ? We're at 20 minutes per person.
@united how on earth could you close the united club in Atlanta? What a major #fail at an airport of this size
@united -LGA-ORD UA 711. Did not get agent name. Argument over baggage policy.
@united yes staff were rude  and unempathetic. I needed jacket and tablet by 4 got at 11. If u take carryons cause plane full.don't lose em!
@United ticket counter Masters out of SMF not very helpful.
@united my baggage is in shannon now so never mind u can work on giving me some $$$ back now
@united if you're listening, why are you the lowest provider of inflight wifi? Get with the times!
@united that's funny because I emailed @VirginAtlantic once and they found it hadn't left LHR. In the mean time stuck with no bag in NYC!!!
@united is the biggest joke of a company,I will never fly with them again! 3 days now waiting for my bag, they don't even know where it is!
@united why haven't you updated that flight 4411 is delayed? Super frustrating
@United what the...? I go into the ""all airlines lounge"" w/ my Star Alliance Club Card in BCN only to be told Star Alliance isn't accepted
@united Y do U not reply to customer refund forms??????????? #unitedairlines
@united &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;------- shoddy customer service. Of no use whatsoever. #unitedairline
@united it has now been 16 days since i applied for my compensation?
Y have i had no correspondence
@united submitted customer care form Jan 7th. Still no response. A little longer then 7 - 10 business days
@united @laurasbrown5 Clearly United lives in the stone age. Some people don't need computers, make your site better for tablets and phones
@united @laurasbrown5 What does ""dealing via email"" have anything to do with a crappy web form that is not made for mobile devices
@united @PGATOUR @NTrustOpen I read that last hashtag as Go F United. Makes sense since they F us by Cancelled Flightling ticketed reservations
@united @gg8929 I'm sorry United isn't able to keep its word 'cuz their IT is totally inadequate but they still says it's a customer fault!
@united How can you not know where my bags are?  You knew where they were 6 hours ago. You are killing me!  Worst service. Ever.
@united Stop pretending you care about the welfare of my daughter. United Airlines had the opportunity to help n failed # United airlines
@united I have received one previously on the 11th having checked. Odd as you said there was no complaint associated with my e-mail?
@united Checking tracing information. You got 2 numbers wrong in my phone number &amp; how did a turquoise duffle bag become a black laptop bag?
@united  treats service members like crap never flying again with them #UnitedAirlines  @CNN
@united What is the point of a UPC code on checked baggage if you can't tell me where my luggage is? Vacation- day 3: trying on swimsuits...
@united how come I have no baggage updates.
@united Thanks for your response. Bags came, but it was a long wait and priority tags weren't honored at all. Disappointing
@United @UnitedAirlines and the hits keep on coming. http://t.co/44ZHmfDIW6 #unitedfail #unitedwithivy
@united 3 hrs searching for flts, find 1 on site &amp; can't book the $ offered bc 1 seg isn't really available. #lies #falseadvertising
@united next flight? Don't think I'll be spending anymore money with you guys ever. It was that bad.
@united are my bags here yet?  They were at Palm Springs airport.  I was at LAX.  How come I beat my bags here.
@united why couldn't you have changed the tire of my delayed UA1127 flight when it arrived instead of waiting until boarding?
@united A generic form with tons of fields asking for info you already?  Expected more as a premier platinum. Another #servicefail
@united, wtf is your username and/or email addr signin STILL unavailable? Been trying to login since Sunday
@united I want my bags. There is vital equipment in there. You are royally screwing me. I'm cranky and want an update.
@united Flight 512 had sime of the rudest flight attendants. I was run over by the drink card and had a flashlight dropped on me. #noapology
@united I am VERY disappointed with @SilverAirways as your partner. No communication, 2 extremely Late Flight flights. Really, all around horrible.
@united missed connection, wrong city, bags at Palm Springs, but not at hotel. I am seriously tired of being treated this way.
@united Where are my bags!!!  They weren't in LAX like your promised.  9 out of 10 things today were a mess today because of you.
@united still haven't received a response. Please direct message me for my contact information.
@united I've been waiting on my bag in IAH for 45mins.  They're only 4 freaking people on that flight waiting for bags.  Fix this!!
@united RTB&gt;IAH 2/17 First class. My wife (Global Services) and I had headaches due to our neighbors smoking e cigarettes. Contact me pls
@united ""federal regulation prohibits you being separated from your bag""...yet you lose our bag and that's okay
@united tried to check it 40 mins before a flight rather than 45 mins and we are stonewalled by your employees...
@united do you guys have any working planes?
@united again, you said to go take the time to go there, knowing what the issue was, and knowing you won’t fix it.
@united 3 hour delay plus a jetway that won't move. This biz traveler is never flying u again!
@united my son is a passenger on flight 3710 from Chicago to Toronto. The plane came within feet of colliding  another plane and is stopped.
@united Yes. It was the airport person who told me the bag was still in Nashville, when I filed the claim. (1/2)
@united Ugh.  My bags were sent to Palm Springs and not to LAX as promised.  They better be at the hotel when I get there.
@united Direct Messaged you, didn't hear anything back
@united yup, it just happens way too often...5 times in the last 12 months
@united so who does handle bag issues? And why wouldn't you put me onto them in the first place?
@united Holiday of a lifetime to New York ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since Sunday! #wontflyagainwithyou
@united my golf bag didn't have a top cover + staffers said they couldn't check without a type of cover or wrap. Forced to leave the bag...
@united when will you offer real food in american clubs like the amazing food you offer in Heathrow?
@united once again my bag is lost when I travel united!!!! Please do something
@united Stuck on plane for over an hour due to mechanical faults. Any updates please? This happened on way to Newark and now again to LHR...
@united did I mention one bag is an infant car seat &amp; we've been stuck with yr poor replacement on icy mtn roads
@united hard to believe since your staff @ SFO checked them under someone by the name of #ritacomo who flew to EWR the same day.
@united it's Late Flight... I'm tired and understandably edgy for trying to catch my flight. I wasn't chipper, but I def was not rude.
@united rude cust ser agents busy chatting, then yelled bc I took pic. Put me stdby when seat. Diff agent gave me seat 30min Late Flightr. Platinum
@united I am a frequent user. Congrats u only lost my bags once in 20 years. Problem, it was today and your staff were rude! still no bag!
@united Yes, though they have not located the bag yet. It was a lovely flight outside of that.
@united My wife has been on the phone several times for past 3 days, with no result.
@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
@united #unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit, not for you to correct your atrocious customer service? Good to know
@united #UnitedAirlines fill out form and never receive response? I expect remedy. We can travel another airline and Cancelled Flight as members w u.
@united 12/13EWR-LAX UA1151 my seat/armrest broken discover after takeoff. flight full.FA filed report, who to chat with for partial refund?
@united so you told me to go, knowing what the issue was, only for me to go there and find out that you won’t fix it?
@united so, I made it all the way to the airport, and they say they won’t fix the handle. I showed you this problem, and you said to go…?
@united then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again.
@united free hotel doesn't make up for such poor customer service and disregard
@united it's messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting.
@united thx for checking in. Never got through via phone. On hold over hour. How long is too long to wait on hold? Ugh. #csfail
@united how else would I know it was denied?
@united You allow shady 3rd party services to sell your tickets and then refuse to help the customer, who's left holding the bag.
#flyunited
@united Hours on the phone...hung up on...all I want is to be on a different flight (same day) that has an open seat. #greatservice
@united which now has maintenance issues with an undetermined amount of time until the mechanics even arrive
@united I can’t go back to the airport, I’m working, and won’t have time.  Are you telling me there is seriously no other way?
@united 3875 to Denver which we are supposed to be boarding right now but has yet to land
@united I've been doing this for 15 years and I've never had this many issues with any other airline.
@united haha that's fine. Still won't fly @united ever again. Seems like you guys have more problems than anyone else.
@united note: they are traveling w 2yr old. Unreal
@united mechanical issues causes delay and connecting plane at ORD only needed to wait 10 min for them. Refused and left early instead. Wtf
@united I'm on one of your 757-300 between JFK and LAX.When r u upgrading planes?Plane has no Screens,lousy seats And that's in UnitedFirst.
@united you already have vomit so you are halfway there
@united is amazing how hard is to talk with customer service! !!
@united fair enough, but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff
@united you guys suck. You delay flights but can't hold the connectors 10 minutes??? #WorstAirlineEver
@united time for a rant...you delayed my flight and still forgot my luggage...then delayed on the Tarmac, moments I love you United
@united - thanks for the rude customer service and 3 hour delay. It really helped me timing wise for my afternoon meetings. Hello @Delta !
@united Useless response. I need a functioning wheelchair, not a customer care form to fill out.
@united $55 cab ride to dfw from love got me my bag. Reimburse?
@united @gg8929 Unbelievable hypocrisy!!
@united On top of this, a CSR went ahead and hung up on me after I called United to discuss this.
@united now finally in memphis. Landed 30 minutes ago. Still no bags. Paying for a service that just gets worse...
@united thanks for a terrible experience at EWR. Customers should be treated as a priority, not as an inconvenience #tryagain
@united The third wheelchair is broken! http://t.co/tvk0PyxQv5
@united my flight was at 1 pm. Still at the airport gee what service.  Do they care, nope.  Delayed until 7:55.
@united very disappointed in CC. Purchased ticket online w/ voucher and charge full amnt. Would not hold price after refund. Unacceptable
@united exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it
I feel completely cheated @united. I read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there.
@united @annricord 0162431184663.
3 of your agents said we would be refunded. Agents said United should never have sold us the ticket.
@United: I feel very well informed. yes, the flight is indeed delayed. Thank you. http://t.co/FuCHZRZjg5
@united Why do I pay more for Coach Plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me
@united can I get some help changing a ticket.  40 minutes on hold and counting....
@united was told by Supervisor that United disconnected their customer support # so there was nobody to address it now. #igiveup
@united Your MileagePlus signup page is broken.
@united $7 for wifi just so I can tell my family I'm gonna be Late Flight cause i had to sit in a grounded plane for the past two hours...
@united FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful.
@united so, not only were you Late Flight, you broke my luggage handle. You paying for a new one? http://t.co/nYVV1X3d67
@united: No friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in SFO followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. #NoFun
@united once again your customer service rep was rude!   I asked a question and in turn got attitude.  Jane was no help.  Disgusted again!
@united poor old United: never seem to get the response right :)
@united obviously the staff at EWR - United or otherwise have not seen your ads about - being FRIENDLY and helpful #ewr worst airport
Hypocrisy RT @united @gg8929 I'm sorry, we're not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for. ^KP
@united I shouldn't have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL
@united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it.
@united said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund.
@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.
@united we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call &amp; was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected.
@united if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!!
@united wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united.
@united I'm 0/3 for Flight Booking Problems without major problems. 0% isn't bad!
@united @el_ingeniero don't check your baggage if you don't have to.  They will lose it!
@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!
@united You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane  is turning around &amp; heading back to the gate. #connection?
@united  Serious firing needs to happen at HNL. They broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! http://t.co/bT37KyrByJ
@united Call customer service and of course they just say ""theres nothing we can do"" and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line.
@united if our already rescheduled flight is Cancelled Flightled is our hotel room paid for?
@united flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input?
@united A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering.
@united thanks for that advice, so helpful. Can't believe you guys actually charge people to ""fly"" united
@united If you have had any issues with  United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead.
@united just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available
@united so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn't receive, how do I know this won't happen this time?
@united stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail
@united @UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united
@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.
@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
@united I'll be sending/posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter.  United airlines should be ashamed.
@United Hidden City forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg. Your support cannot fix. :-(
@united missed it.  Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight...
@united yes still need assistance I don't have a flight home due to change in flight u made I miss all connections !
@united thanks! We would like an apology and a full refund. Please confirm when we will receive.
@united My flight UA1159 to Denver for #RMOUG15 has been re-cheduled 5 times.
If I am no show, you'll know why! Ridiculous.
@united you're just using automated  responses and don't have the decency to actually care/respond
@united JT the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service
@united I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone
@united no claim number. Haven't been back to iAd baggage since. Is there a phone I can call to speak to someone?
@united worst service ever 
@united thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option?
@united can't believe United can't find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice
@united I am furious.  You're firm is a disgrace. Despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter. All alone at night # United
@united Your website Flight Booking Problems experience is an obnoxious upsell-laden disaster for anyone with half a brain.
@united Flt 4487 is having some MAJOR delays bc ground crew was so SLOW. The flight crew has been terrific. Been 2 hours on the ground.....
@united sorry, I hate united. i won't get to see my family until Thursday
@United Your customer service for Mileage Plus customers is a disgrace. I just spent 45 min on the phone to reset a pin number, with no luck
@united All these changes. Way to stick it to your Premiere 1K loyal customers. Why make things harder for those that loyal to you?
@united thanks for the offer, but I finally made it to my destination, albeit hours Late Flight.
@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. We are done flying #UnitedAirlines.
@united it would be super if you paid as much attention to actual fliers as you do to credit card holders.
@united I travel a lot and I get it. You're still my fave but EWR to Cleveland w/40 min layover to connect to DC = our best option? Come on.
@united 3pm and my bags still not here. not even a courtesy toiletries kit. not the flight experience I was expecting, very disappointed.
@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. Done flying #UnitedAirlines.
@united flight 86 LAX-IAD, back rows NOT CLEANED prior to boarding. How gross is that to find used tissues in your seat?  Please.
@united plus you horrible seating and poor customer service everywhere I've flown. now you take away the mileage program..horrible
@united you'd learn if you listen to your customers...you do want you want...@VirginAmerica asks their customer what they want
@united customer service 
@united Priceless. United stranded my daughter at O'Hare. United did zero to keep her safe.....alone on a plastic chair for 9h! # United Air
@united 3359 which you finally Cancelled Flightled.
@united thanks finally made it.. Missed meetings but what can I do now?
@united Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 1:40pm &amp; now we won't leave until 5. This is the 2nd time this has happened
@united Supposedly, they're out for delivery. I'll believe it when I see it.
@united Hi JH, my experience with United has been entirely disgusting but yes, I'd like assistance in getting compensated for my bag.
@united I can't even fit my name on the first two lines, yes... Please do pass on feedback. This is a big downgrade from previous years.
@united no, it was 2 flight Cancelled Flightlations (one due to weather, one mechanical) paid own hotel, bag held in transfer. No voucher/compensation
@united i got email that my reservations got Cancelled Flightled and i will be refunded.  Nothing got refunded as of yet
@united So what do you offer now that my flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm stranded away from home and work?
@united you are really trying me today.
@united no they were to busy taking to each other and I needed to get to an audition.
@united quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through - not really the service I was expecting
@united Stuck in IAD going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from Nashville that u can't tell when it will arrive?!! Ridiculous!!
@united flt 4567 no gate agent, no announcements. So unprofessional. Time to go back to @Delta
@united flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. Why don't you figure out a solution and announce once?
@united bags are still in Houston since Friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee.
@united flight 4567 have already been Cancelled Flightled once, been trying to get home two days. Staff being very unhelpful.
@united each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don't even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats!
@united waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude
@united I don't need to make any changes. I reserved my seats when I bought my tickets and there was an error &amp; now there are no comp seats
@united its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to California? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic!
@united I'm not this person, but I've been sitting in Denver for three hours and all I want to do is get on a plane. Please let me go home.
@united  flight 441 on 2/4 was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up!
@united which is why my next flights to Miami will be on another airline.
@united It is super frustrating that the folks at the United Ticket Counter in Pittsburg aren't honoring their own Media Rate! #unitedfail
@united 45 minutes after arrival and no bags for most people. UA469 from den to ewr. How long should we wait until a ual rep comes here?
@united with Karen and found her unhelpful and rude  called United at the time &amp; told she could board but Karen would not accept
@united she has crossed 4 prior times with other carriers and no issue. Karen was rude, untrained and unhelpful I also spoke
@united 2 employee yelled at her. 3 employee stood with others whispering and pointing at her from behind counter
@united 1 refused boarding with Nexus. nexus confirmed she should not be refused
@united u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee? Does that make sense to you? And yes I already called cust svc. They said no.
@United yall tried it with this little bitty plane flying out of boston!! I hate little planes!!!
@united the refund request functionality on http://t.co/5IMDckODfx is broken.i get a time out error.
@united @NY_NJairports Only at Newark can you land 15 minutes early but lose all that time waiting on tarmac for a gate.
@united giving up on your direct flight from IAH to Honolulu. 3rd attempt in 3 years - 3rd delay.  $7 meal voucher. Wow. Customer service!
@united Nearly 48 hours Late Flightr and still no idea where it is. I will never fly United again if I can help it.
@united 1591 had wi-fi broken on plane. Had same outage on 1618 on Friday. How can Southwest get it right on every plane but United can't?
@united Second day &amp; attempt trying to leave IAD &amp; I'm on another plane delayed for mechanical issues. Over an hour delayed!
@united when is my plane coming?  Been delayed for almost 7 hours. No plane.
@united Not fast enough.  No excuse for service between big hubs to have such outdated craft. Southwest has wifi. This is awful.
@united my mother's flight was delayed from phl-ord. We're on our way to NRT and the gate refused to upgrade. A platinum.  Blegh
@united is Late Flight again.  Everyone braved the weather and 40 passengers are waiting for a flight crew.  Really!
@united Miserable trip ... lost bag Sat... found Mon... lost again... shipping 2nd day ground Tues... might have it for return flight home
@united spending the afternoon @ Mia. Not your fault.  No lounge? Very inconvenient.
@united costumer service sucks! Waiting for a week for a response
@united I was denied use of a rear facing car seat on UA5025, an ERJ145. Can you confirm the actual policy?
@united you better hold my flight to Tucson #5237, just landed in Houston after an hour delay for some minor computer problem
@united dropped off a luggage at IAD over 2 months ago for repair from damages haven't heard anything about it since, when do I get it back?
@united feck guys. Stop Cancelled Flightling flights from EWR to RIC the weather is fine I both locations!!!
@united Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don't notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant.
@united + besides, no small degree of self-interest. We take that route several times a year &amp; would hate to be in that situation.
.@united we rebooked. But @casleah and I had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours? Frustrating.
@united + that's the gist of what the flight attendant told her.
@united BTW is it true you have to remind flight staff after checking in even after indicating meal prefer on your reservation? +
@united +what took me aback was the response by the flight attendant, who put the responsibility squarely back on passenger's shoulders. +
@united No but u cld explain how such a disorganized and inefficient company w surly and obviously unhappy employees stays in business.
@united sat at airport for 5 hrs still sitting at gate..  Sigh
@united Gold Star for united- change my flight- miss all connections- but can't accommodate me until a MUCH Late Flightr arrival time-Not HAPPY!
@united did not let me get on the IAH-HNL direct. Now weather delay for my SFO leg. Stop being reactive and be proactive!
@united why am i mot getting my refund?
.@united nothing apparently. I've flown w/ you 4 times in last 3 weeks and 3 of those experiences (incl today) were clusterfucks.
@united THRILLED to have my carry-on checked against my will by two nasty gate agents only to see an entire empty bin when I boarded last...
@united what if business as usual meant dropping the bully mentality and fostering inspiration for a greater business #EmployeeRelations
@United - Ridiculous to fly outdated 757s anywhere much less btwn IAH and SFO. No power ports, no  Wifi, no personal entertainment. TORTURE
@united last night we waited forever at the gate because someone from corporate dispatch FORGOT to call the crew #unfriendlyskies
@united Broken entertainment system on my 8 hour NYC flight, terrible cabin crew service and online complaint form won't work #hopeless
.@united call my work and tell them it's your fault I'm Late Flight
@United is officially the worst, most delayed, and least helpful airline I have ever had the misfortune of flying on
@united i have items of sentimental value that I'm heartbroken are missing
@united still waiting for a reply
@united please see a flight attendant for what? Why isn't there enough room for over head bags? I carry on to save time!!!
@united I tried 2 DM it would not go thru... not sure why
@united, link to current status of flights/airports? Fly BWI-EWR-MCO this morning yet can't yet tell what any problems are except see snow.
@united I like delays less than you because I'm the one on the plane. Connect me with a voucher
@united and don't hope for me having a nicer flight some other time, try to do things right. You sold me those tickets with that connetion
@united the we got into the gate at IAH on time and have given our seats and closed the flight. If you know people is arriving, have to wait
@united yes. We waited in line for almost an hour to do so. Some passengers just left not wanting to wait past 1am.
@SouthwestAir still waiting. Just hit one hour.
@SouthwestAir Hello - been on hold for extremely long time. Have confirmation # &amp; can't get boarding pass. Have tried numerous times!!
@SouthwestAir Very frustrated for the loooooong wait time to speak to a live person!!! Cannot get boarding pass for flight tomorrow!!
@SouthwestAir still no update text #2053 &amp; still no response to email fr1/5/2015 SR #256746438028. Feel like yr losing customer service/care
@SouthwestAir your agents were the ones who were rude and unhelpful and prompted my initial tweet. This is so easy to fix.
@SouthwestAir my wife had been in group A in prev. flight but got bumped for some reason.  Alone with two kids. At least put her in group A
@SouthwestAir my flight was delayed 4 hrs. I'm 5 months pregnant &amp; supposed to be caring for my mom whose in surgery now. Very upset.
@SouthwestAir Been on hold 34 min so far trying to book seat for my infant. Price increased $42 in meantime. What do I do?
@SouthwestAir poor performance all around! Paid for Express checkin weeks ago and can't even leverage it #bullshit
@SouthwestAir can you have someone call me back? I have been on hold two times today for over 20 min and still haven't gotten through
@SouthwestAir has grounded 2 flights b/c of equipment problems &amp; been rude to my wife, traveling alone w/our 2 young kids.  never again.
@SouthwestAir oh look you just delayed our flight an additional half hour now arriving at 6 officially five hours after planned. 
@SouthwestAir belt issues. Been a rough day for them. Worst part is traveling with 9 month old and having to wait outside in 85 degree
@SouthwestAir  got my bags 35 hours Late Flightr and an offer of $50 to go pick them up. Taxi costs $65 one way. Spent $200 for the inconvenience.
@SouthwestAir  appreciate y'all getting the gate issue figured GRR. Plenty open gates, yet we sit and wait on tarmac
@SouthwestAir 20 minutes on hold waiting is ridiculous......
@SouthwestAir went to purchase a flight that I began processing not even 4 minutes earlier and the points had gone up - any help?
@SouthwestAir I'm so upset that my luggage was damaged and the rude employee at the Laguardia airport didn't help!
@SouthwestAir its flight #218 of that matters to you all. Hell next we all won't get our luggage properly transferred #facepalm #smh
@SouthwestAir your phone service sucks
@SouthwestAir and now our arrival is delayed nearly 5hours. Yeah an entire day in an airport is not my idea of a stress less vacation #fail
@SouthwestAir oh and now your company has caused us to lose an entire day of our vacation in Cancun. De Boarded waiting for another plane
@SouthwestAir My first call got dropped. Waited 15 mins for the second but ran out of time. Will try again Late Flightr. No way to do this online?
@SouthwestAir great now we are all de boarding perfectly plane is shot. Fml. Plans are screwed. Thanks for nothing @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir had to let us off the plane bc the toilets done even work! There goes my family vacay to playa del Carmen, Mexico! #neveragain
@SouthwestAir thanks for the apology. Unfortunately i have had one too many bad experiences and will no longer be flying with southwest.
@SouthwestAir @SMiles1307 over two hours now.  Ugh we should all get vouchers this is inexcusable ESP after a pre flight check that was ok.
@SouthwestAir horrible experience, passenger of size was 1/3 in my seat, offered $50 voucher for this by Christine C http://t.co/1xzrK66wVQ
@SouthwestAir need to learn how to treat people with respect and just a little dignity. #FAIL
@SouthwestAir Redeem-points packages magically gone by time we finally got through @ 10:01, felt like #baitandswitch
@SouthwestAir I think I get a faster response on Twitter than I do when I call...what's up with that?
@SouthwestAir then had to watch the staff check off each passenger on the list TWICE, because the first time they forgot look at IDs. Brutal
@SouthwestAir was on flight 2373 from CHI-BUF last night, almost 2 hour delay cuz someone got on the plane without a pass - sounds safe. 1/2
@SouthwestAir Rapid Rewards program sold me short. #Lasttweetaboutthis but still #disappointed.
@SouthwestAir freezing in the plane
@SouthwestAir where your airline people screwed up our boarding passes on the way back from puerto Vallarta. This is horrible and we are
@SouthwestAir from groupA to group C. We have never got to sit next to each other on any south west flight not even on our honey moon
@SouthwestAir flight to Atlanta getting Cancelled Flightled and then had to re schedule on the phone for over 1.5 hours with a rep this bumping us
@SouthwestAir due to an apparent water issue that checked out fine during the checks my husband and I already had to deal with our first
@SouthwestAir u have a lot of pissed off hungry tired people stuck at midway 4 over 2 hours after scheduled departure. This is inexcusable
@SouthwestAir do you know that your lost baggage portal http://t.co/hUcLXluV5h doesn't work on mobile? It's a 404 http://t.co/O4ZR27Qpcr
@SouthwestAir if you're going to charge for wifi, do us all a solid and make sure it doesn't take the length of the flight to open a page
@SouthwestAir SWA helps the hotel industry. I always book flights a day before I need to be somewhere as SWA consistent Cancelled Flights/delays.
@SouthwestAir unfortunately once the call was answered service was horrid. SWA was the role-model of finger pointing &amp; excuses #DISAPPOINTED
@SouthwestAir frustrating indeed especially when no one knows what the issue is....
@SouthwestAir  on hold with customer service; you may be quicker.  I rebooked trip for a lower fare.  Where did the difference in $ go?
@SouthwestAir and thx for not responding
@SouthwestAir I booked a flight on my phone and then never got a confirmation email. How would I go about getting that?
@SouthwestAir how come I'm not getting my points after I buy from the rapid reward shopping site?
@SouthwestAir mins and no answer. My wife and baby need to get on that flight. She arrived 2 hrs prior. Please help. Venetia Crook
@SouthwestAir my wife and 9 month old might miss flight and next direct is 210 pm. Mother in law been on hold with customer support for 30

@SouthwestAir Hey, friends. When I phone the A-list number your IVR hangs up on me. Multiple times. Not sure how to proceed?
@SouthwestAir LA always has traffic, but this is INSANE. I can't be the only one with this issue on flight 1625
@SouthwestAir INSANE traffic in LA. Trying to call you all to re schedule flight but been on phone for 20 minutes and nothing.
@SouthwestAir Why can we no longer change trips with a companion online? Been doing it for years, now get message can't be done online?
@SouthwestAir Adding RR number to a @Marriott stay is too hard. Won't take RR number at checkin/out and Marriott phone CS not helpful.
@SouthwestAir NOR @SpiritAirlines fly to Toronto?!?!? You're killing me smalls.......
@SouthwestAir I have used you guys for most my travels, but this last experience I will never use southwest again! #worstcustomerservice
@SouthwestAir: #VIPLiveintheVieyard - first time we tried to redeem pts for *anything*, it really did not go well. #disappointed
@SouthwestAir Switching planes due to mechanical problems.  How does reboarding work? Was A49, now at end of long line.  Stuck in middle?
@SouthwestAir: Tried for VIP Live in The Vineyard but yr site went down, by the time I got in 2 redeem pts those packages gone.
@SouthwestAir why was Southwest only airline to Cancelled Flight all flights from Charleston? Was 7:50pm flight Cancelled Flightation really weather reLate Flightd?
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the text, but not exactly timely 8). Data throughout issues today maybe? http://t.co/aaU9MKA6Zy
@SouthwestAir I called the 800 # and the rep there was pleasant but less than helpful! Told me I was SOL. Train them for consistent #CX!
@SouthwestAir 25 year customer but I am 6 3 and those lost 2 or 3 inches really hurt  every time the person in front shifts he raps my knees
@SouthwestAir why is customer relations still not open....in Texas?!
@SouthwestAir   I hate evolved seating. knees in the seat pocket http://t.co/forNpF69Ky
@SouthwestAir I ""heart"" Southwest but those commercials aimed to satisfy a nano-smattering of travelers to few destinations.
@SouthwestAir no need, I know the status, you Cancelled Flightled instead of delaying the flight.
@SouthwestAir weather where? And at what time Cancelled Flighted? No I can't because meeting was today.
@SouthwestAir I luv y'all but please stop overheating your planes. Second flight in a row that feels like a sauna.
@SouthwestAir i have asked Lindsey to call me instead of DM like a schoolgirl but so far no call   Getting tired of typing little notes
@SouthwestAir give us some more clever advertising about #bagsflyfree is that because #badpolicy allows you to #cheatcustomers
@SouthwestAir it's just the principle - it's hard to get mugged &amp; not be upset you took my money &amp; didn't give me anything #wrongiswrong
@SouthwestAir customer service you shouldn't use those words wasted my time and took my money #BadBussiness #Theft http://t.co/63zaQ2lt8f
@SouthwestAir three hour flight to Orlando and no wifi? Uncool. #firstworldproblems
@SouthwestAir customer service at FLL, BWI,and PIT have been terrible.no one knows where his bags are.his is on a job with no clothes &amp; gear
@SouthwestAir After multiple attempts, I was finally able to submit them Late Flight last night.
@SouthwestAir up at 4AM and arrive to find it already Cancelled Flighted. No options so miss my meeting. You might ""know"" but don't show it.
@SouthwestAir hey remember that time you lost my husbands bags? I do. 
#filmjobnoequipment 
#nowarmclothes
@SouthwestAir you need to redeem yourself. I lost respect for you tonight #lostbags #filmjobnoequipment
@SouthwestAir way to fuck up and lose @c_istudios bags. My husband has no warm clothes and no equipment. #youdidit #notcool
@SouthwestAir wifi stays connected about the lifetime of a higgs boson
@SouthwestAir we can let #bags flutter because we charge travelers that had to change dates #fullprice and we don't let them travel
@SouthwestAir won't let me send a DM because they don't follow me.. #lovedflyingwiththem #notanymore #wrong #badpolicy
@SouthwestAir has become like every other airline #crooked I can't believe they are taking over $500 #shouldwearmasks #shocked
@SouthwestAir here is my conf #F8NEQM. My flight was delayed for 3 hours while my friend waited for me on her bday. Please follow up.
@SouthwestAir Twitter cust svc rule 1 Dont say IF we fell short. I just told u u did! #2 If u cant solve problem don't say anything at all!
@SouthwestAir disappointed in the 'service' I've received. Checked in online, checked my my flight status online, CHECKED IN AT THE AIRPORT
@SouthwestAir very disappointed in your customer service right now. definitely not feeling the luv. what's worse, 2nd time this winter.
@SouthwestAir when I called I was told my bag had made it to PHL, but still has not been delivered or any call from the delivery service
@SouthwestAir Should be a way to give voice to customers who pay for services that are not satisfactorily delivered. #justsayin
@SouthwestAir I am genuinely surprised you all don't upgrade people when you Cancelled Flight their flights or at least put them in a comparable spot
@SouthwestAir would someone please DM me the customer relations number. The website has only customer service.
@SouthwestAir : This is the second time in a row I haven't received text updates about flight time change. Don't offer if you won't use it
@SouthwestAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight and now I am in the back of the queue and you want to charge me 200  for business class? Stay classy
@SouthwestAir hope your flyers get a credit of some sort for all the delays and Cancelled Flightlations #shittydeal #notimpressed
@SouthwestAir NOW you love me? After taking my money and only taking me halfway home. Sorry. Too Late Flight
@SouthwestAir wifi is so slow! What is the point having one if can't get on the Internet?! Ugh...
@SouthwestAir hasn't evennotified us that theflight isdelayed via email/text/phone call.If we wererunning Late Flight I would be pissed #unreliable
@SouthwestAir can tweet through the weekend/ bad weather, but closes down customer relations center to process refunds for Cancelled Flighted flights.
@SouthwestAir stop Cancelled Flighting my flight I have US history tests to take and chemistry things to learn do you not understand!!!!!!!!!
@SouthwestAir my question is this: what's up with the crazy boarding procedure? Does the confusion prevent fistfights over the good seats?
@SouthwestAir prove it, Cuz the southwest people here don't even know why it's behind schedule.
@SouthwestAir u were bae until u lost both of my bags and had no clue where they were or what happened to them for 36 hours :/
@SouthwestAir prove it
@SouthwestAir thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really?
@SouthwestAir ruined my Sunday. 3+ hours of delays out of DIA, now my bags are at the wrong airport. $35 to deliver them? Insult to injury.
@SouthwestAir right? We're delayed so I'm crabby. :) Also why do you allow one family member to purchase EarlyBird check in and hold rows?
@SouthwestAir 10+ people pre boarded
Only 1 needed a wheel chair off the plane... Was NOT the case boarding
@SouthwestAir  Poor customer service displayed over the weekend during the storm. I was stuck on the tarmac for 2.5 hours with no answer!
@SouthwestAir Feeling very frustrated that I bought WIFI onboard and can't load an email.
@SouthwestAir why do you let one person board with early bird and save seats for entire party? #notcool #flight2149
@SouthwestAir but when do I get my gin &amp; tonic !?!?
@SouthwestAir is this a sick joke? #toyingwithouremotions
@SouthwestAir , please explain to me why every other flight to Dallas is going out today except the 6:35 pm?????
@SouthwestAir will continue to be my airline of choice. @united -most frustrating travel day I've experienced. 5 delays and 4 gate changes?!
@SouthwestAir @fox8news Serious potential for a wanna get away commercial out of this debacle.  But for real, you should fire @Kristi_Capel
@SouthwestAir I appreciate the response, but the constant changing of the flight time is frustrating to say the least. #toughtomakeplans
@SouthwestAir how long do we have to be delayed after boarding before we get a free drink? #gettingthirsty
@SouthwestAir I can. Doesn't it seem fair that if our bags need to fit under our seats, we should need to fit in them?
@SouthwestAir Just wanted 2 change an anytime flight leaving at 11:50 @ 11:00. Phone hold 4 46mins. Phone answers, she says sorry - no dice.
@SouthwestAir weren't too ""sincere"" when you Cancelled Flighted my flight and made me drive 17 hours to get home..
@SouthwestAir pretty terrible customer service. Sat on hold 10 min. Then a busy signal. Then disconnected. Do all airlines have to suck?
@SouthwestAir this is not a fair set up. I payed for a full seat. I should get access to a full seat. http://t.co/SbA0ARicyq
@SouthwestAir Sorry to bother you, but I've been on hold for more than 2 hours and 30 minutes. Should I continue holding? Or call back?
@SouthwestAir  your checkin is lame for business. Really last seat? I have broad shoulders haha
@SouthwestAir Completely understand Act of God weather-reLate Flightd Cancelled Flightlation, but 4 days without reimbursement of any kind is #unacceptable
@SouthwestAir why so expensive to go to Vegas with stops in Late Flight June as I can get non stop for same on competition
@SouthwestAir delayed twice now Cancelled Flighted...sent complaint email, yet no response.  Need an explanation pls. #notsatisfied #smh #unhappy
@SouthwestAir When will the flight resume? I don's see it in the open schedule. :/
@SouthwestAir My bag was not shown LUV did not make it to PHL with me.
@SouthwestAir I regret not flying you this morning @VirginAmerica doesn't support business travelers. #neverflyvirginforbusiness
@SouthwestAir a companion pass flyer to other airlines because it's being abused @ every airport...
@SouthwestAir it's not disappointment, it's a blatant disregard for your business select customers, it's becoming a problem that's pushing
@SouthwestAir My bags are on the way to Chicago, without me! Help! I was confirmed for 2 flights and told there isn't room and I'm screwed.
@SouthwestAir i just recieved an email from your memphis station hopefully they have my bag.
@SouthwestAir yep. 99.99999999% certain it was on that flight.
@SouthwestAir I never got an email confirmation for my ticket, but the credit card was charged.  Phone wait time is crazy. Is there a chat?
@SouthwestAir res chg online/app no work, still on hold, faster for hubby to DRIVE to airport to make change @ counter #fail
@SouthwestAir I did, but no one can find the bag and we need everything in it in the next two hours.
@SouthwestAir Wasn't able to sit in my seat since the guy next to me was using it. #worstflightever #ideserveareward http://t.co/l7hSnLgie2
@SouthwestAir yes we did file a report and were treated rather rudely at midway baggage claim. Now we wait 2 days to get our luggage.
@SouthwestAir I would still have my companion pass if your ridiculous airline hadn't stopped partnering with Hilton Hotels - GENIUS!!!
@SouthwestAir Password reset email is incredibly slow to arrive today. Checked spam folder, too. Web site says a few minutes, but 15? :|
@SouthwestAir I've had TERRIBLE service in three airports in 10 hours. Glad they don't care we kind of need to be home. #SellMyPointsSoon
@SouthwestAir on hold for 15+ min...no estimated answer time. Any help here?
@SouthwestAir I'm going to start charging you for the consistent body pat downs. Starting to feel like a piece of meat. #punishedforflying
@SouthwestAir What's up with the wait times on your customer service line? Tried 2X on Fri. and now I've been on for over 15 min.
@SouthwestAir flight 1028 no delayed 1.5 hours.  Another week another delayed flight
@SouthwestAir bag in possession but no clothes in bag??
@SouthwestAir Please get back with my about my airtran credit Q4VNMB, I call and I'm being told that I will, but I never get email/call back
@SouthwestAir what to do when you show up to your destination with no clothes in your suitcase? #nakedmeetings #awkward
@southwestair does anyone realize that banning peanuts on a flight due to an allergic person ignores p-nut oil &amp; dust from previous flights?
@SouthwestAir customer service is rude and bothered by our calls. Has no idea what is going on and sighed heavily on the phone. Unbelievable
@SouthwestAir @nelsjeff, 3.5 hrs. Late Flightr (no human interaction), ended up $'ing a completely new flight - so last flight out didn't sell out.
@SouthwestAir loses baggage a day ago and still has no idea or interest in finding it? ALL items for new job in that bag! Unacceptable.
@SouthwestAir how about fixing the wifi!  3rd flight where it's not working. 800 series plane so not like it's an old plane.
@SouthwestAir RT @kkwhb: Paid for early bird boarding and got B46.  I said to lady, ""well, that system is about dead."" She didn't understand
@SouthwestAir All flights are booked . They are saying I have to wait until tomorrow.
@SouthwestAir Gate agent gave me wrong departure info and caused me to miss my flight and now I am on stand by! #NotHappy
@SouthwestAir my bag was lost, and according to the rep they don't even know where it is, Please help.
@SouthwestAir - really?  All other carriers are staffed and you've got a triple looped one and no employees in sight in OKC
@SouthwestAir thank you for Cancelled Flighting my flight, last minute of course, to #GIS2015. I'm now missing one full day of my trip thanks to this!
@SouthwestAir you got me home over an hour and a half Late Flight but at least my baggage was delivered soaking wet
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight, rescheduled to EWK gave me a pseudo-voucher that directed me to the worst @daysinn in existence. #fail
@SouthwestAir needs to train their employees to be at lease somewhat empathetic when THEY lose our luggage.  Monika at MWA needs a PR lesson
@SouthwestAir You completely let me down tonight. Your gate agents' ambivalence is just too much. How sad for you (&amp; me.)
@SouthwestAir flight Cancelled Flightled. new flight 7 hours Late Flightr. will sleep in airport tonight. and cant even give me an A Boarding Group seat. thx
@SouthwestAir you're right, I do. I've been traveling all day and you guys dropped the ball. Making for a long night.
@SouthwestAir @jparkermastin  customer service has been very passive in their response. Disappointed. I have only flown SW but am rethinking
@SouthwestAir broke the stroller my wife and baby gate checked. They told her it's not their problem. Calling the A List Preferred line now.
@SouthwestAir is this a joke? My return flight is delayed too! 3 in a row! New record from you guys 
@SouthwestAir luggage delivery between 1-4am? Really? After I was told by midnight multiple times? Why lie? Crazy and bad business.
@SouthwestAir now I don't get the common courtesy of my phone call answered. Either policy is bad or people should be fired. #dissaponted
@SouthwestAir apologies are whatever. Please just deliver the bags like you said you would. Feel like employees are lying to me.
@SouthwestAir what robot is running this account. The same one that doesn't remember anything they ask. Same conversation over and over.
@SouthwestAir is not being responding to the @SpecialOlympics athletes.  #notcool #Southwest
@SouthwestAir   A whole family, with a special Olympic athlete here, and you can't even call them? 617-653-3040
@SouthwestAir would really like my baggage from yesterday. Employees at Akron giving me a tough time.
.@SouthwestAir glad you appreciate it, it’ll be the last dollar you ever get from me thanks to your wretched customer service
@SouthwestAir waited 34 mins for baggage MDW&gt;MEM and the in-flight service was suspended so no drink 
@SouthwestAir @fly2midway 45 minute wait for my bags. Just what I needed on a Sunday night.
@SouthwestAir it's ok I was supposed to be in California 5hrs ago
@SouthwestAir I need to Cancelled Flight one leg of a flight, but can't seem to do this online. Been on hold on the phone for 10 minutes. Any help?
@SouthwestAir A-list preferred. DEN-DAL flight Cancelled Flightled 30 min prior to boarding. Best option was Tue afternoon. Seriously?!? Epic fail.
@SouthwestAir i got the call from RDU that my baggage is there except that doesn't help me bc i can't get it until I'm flying back home.
@SouthwestAir For example, can't pay 4 hotel &amp; food? Or transport to alternate city we are flying from? Or give clear record of alt flight?
@SouthwestAir Tough I can take. Zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. Looking for signs you care abt cust.
@SouthwestAir Don't apologize. Do something about it. Words mean nothing. Actions work. EOM.
@SouthwestAir after an hour and a half then it came back damaged. Not happy 
@SouthwestAir why does the customer service have rather inconsistent information
@SouthwestAir but to make us tru to find space in other flights.  This customer service is as bad as @SpiritAirlines.
@SouthwestAir no delay. I pay $777.70 for BS A1 ticket. You boarded flight early. I'm last to board. Now have middle seat. Wasted $$$$!
@SouthwestAir first you had a good idea thatthis would happen and did not Cancelled Flight it earlier, then very amateurish that there was no plan.
@SouthwestAir very disappointed in your handling of tonight's Cancelled Flighted Dallas flight.  Not that it was Cancelled Flighted but no contingencies.
@SouthwestAir no you are not, you just care about mighty dollar.
But expect no help from -&gt;@SouthwestAir &lt;-.  Our flt was canx at the last minute for ""weather.""  We flew home on weatherless @united.
@SouthwestAir really shouldn't offer sweeps if your link isn't going to work! B http://t.co/nOfG0TQHYN
@SouthwestAir WIFI is so slow it totally precludes working on the web. Will NOT book SWA for business travel. Wish I hadn't lit $24 on fire
@SouthwestAir everyone deserves red carpet tx until they destroy your luggage &amp;only give you $75 voucher, like I want to fly w/them again!
@SouthwestAir staff was overall awful through multiple airports would have switched airlines if another flight was available
@southwestair on flight 3130 and I paid $8 for wifi that can't load a website functionally except for your own live streaming. Unacceptable.
@SouthwestAir You've inspired me to start my own airline to combat your weak ass airline. sick of this shit
@SouthwestAir wifi is the worst $8 investment I have ever made.
@SouthwestAir sitting in Newark because flight 4179 was Cancelled Flightled for no apparent reason.  All I was told was sorry after 2.5 hrs waiting
@SouthwestAir couldn't be bothered to help with my lost my luggage. Not a single helpful employee owner to be found in BWI.
@SouthwestAir Seriously? FOUR DELAYS? Only takes 42 minutes to get to Vegas from @flyLAXairport &amp; I have a connecting flight. #ridiculous
@SouthwestAir should get their shit together before they owe my $2,000 for my bag.
@SouthwestAir I requested my boarding pass to be texted to me but I still haven't received it.
@SouthwestAir I gave you one more try. Figured you could get a 1 hr flight right. Nope. Delayed an hr. Seems to be every time.
@SouthwestAir I'm gonna ignore the fasten seatbelt sign and I want to see if ur man enough to do anything about it!!!
@SouthwestAir I'm a huge fan and give y'all too much business...so please fix the damn wifi!
@SouthwestAir  we understand air delays which are out of your control, terrible telephone support, apps and online access that do not work??
@SouthwestAir now I can't board thanks. You guys moved me to standby. I've been holding this boarding pass since 7pm yesterday
@SouthwestAir Two delayed flights in a row. Neither one of them explained
@SouthwestAir been sleeping on the floor like I'm homeless and now delayed flights because the equipment isn't working! I have a job to get2
@SouthwestAir you guys should stop doing service in Denver it's horrible I get stuck here every time! I've been here almost 24hrs
@SouthwestAir Had a very unpleasant experience over the phone with one of your agents re: a Cancelled Flightled flight. I have the name &amp; agent ID.
@SouthwestAir your wifi is angering me with its slowness
@SouthwestAir we've been at the gate a long time. We're gonna miss our connection at MDW. Ack! http://t.co/qRXvZFrD1Z
@SouthwestAir Sort of, but I'm arriving a day Late Flight and have to incur overnight costs in a connecting city. Not cool at all...
@SouthwestAir promised 4 rooms until Wednesday, (wentook3) and the hotel charged us $79 per room because we had a pink paper needed white?
@SouthwestAir if you have a rules you should probably apply them all the times not just sometimes. #shouldhaveflownjetblue
@SouthwestAir baggage delivery at BWI very delayed and unnecessarily chaotic. Disappointing after a long trip! From a frequent traveler
@SouthwestAir extremely frustrating travel experience in Denver! Instead of landing in SEA on Saturday, now it's Monday afternoon!
@SouthwestAir I will be calling someone on Monday in customer relations. Very disappointed in how I was treated by customer service!
@SouthwestAir your ""complimentary"" hotel vouchers are BS! $79 a night for the crappiest hotel ever! I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy!
@SouthwestAir worst air line ever, you have no compassion of the handicapped
@SouthwestAir you are a bunch of liars! Cancelled Flightled our flight and rebooked us four days Late Flightr!
@SouthwestAir my golf bag was broken on the flight I just took. What's the process for damage reimbursement?
@SouthwestAir ridiculous how you want to charge me $209 to change flights even with multiple seats available on the flight I needed
@SouthwestAir - thanks for Cancelled Flighting our flight to BOS. We're stranded in DEN til Wed night. The 7 of us will never fly #southwest again
@SouthwestAir I was trying to find airfare for my family.  Your prices are ridiculous!  Almost $1000 more than @USAirways. #notmadeofmoney
@SouthwestAir our flight is delayed till tomorrow curse the weather
@SouthwestAir BTW I was completely unable to buy wifi for my flight using Galaxy S4. Couldn't zoom out or scroll to touch ""Buy""

@SouthwestAir wife's flight to DAL just got Cancelled Flightled. What does she do to find options to get back home?  1708 PHX-&gt;DAL
.@SouthwestAir thx for the note. Flight was Cancelled Flightled and today is all booked so had to go with another carrier. :(
@SouthwestAir Flight 52 got Cancelled Flightled 6 hrs before takeoff. No Customer Service. Been on hold for 30 minutes.
@SouthwestAir waiting over a half hour for my checked baggage to be delivered! No updates from any ground crew
@SouthwestAir No like I said I could not reach anyone at your company so I had to rent a car and chalk the whole thing up to a loss
@SouthwestAir As a frequent traveler, I've never been treated so coldly &amp; had an airline offer nothing when my flight was Cancelled Flightled. #nolove
@SouthwestAir - neveryamind I paid $450 for a flight. 250 for a new bag is easy for business class customers, right? http://t.co/vn3JJIa53O
@SouthwestAir - our baggage motto: we don't cover that. Small tear, ripped seam, snow soaked, busted zippers - SORRY http://t.co/LHwFBKFynI
@SouthwestAir Totally ruined my birthday weekend by Cancelled Flighting my flights for no reason and offer no points, drink, transport. #nolove #cali
@SouthwestAir What's happened to your customer service? 2 Cancelled Flightled flights in 2 days &amp; an uninformed and unapologetic staff. #nolove #cali
@SouthwestAir Maybe if you comped those that quietly accepted delays or Cancelled Flightations instead of the irate you'd have less issues #justsaying
@SouthwestAir we didn't nothing was ruined just wet. Just frustrating when after traveling for 12 hours you can't change into clean clothes
@SouthwestAir I tried for 5hrs to contact SW! Twitter, fb, phone, email w/ no reply. 24hrs Late Flightr u respond, what could you do at this point?
@SouthwestAir I have never had such awful customer service and conflicting service. Outrageous.
@SouthwestAir no I wasn't. After over an hour was too frustrated and had to hang up.
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the terrible service! Stranded in MDW for 2 days, &amp; now can't find confirmation for rebooked flight from MKE.
@SouthwestAir @AARP @JimCramer 75yo mom says, ""Hire more staff to accommodate your audience"" You could learn lots from her. She's off to FL
@SouthwestAir I was never able to talk so someone so had to buy another new ticket. Will be calling shortly for refund.

@SouthwestAir, I've been on hold for 3 hrs. now, waiting to talk to someone with a pulse to get my Cancelled Flighted flight rescheduled. Is this SOP?

@SouthwestAir On hold for two hours and it timed-out on me. Great system you got there.
@SouthwestAir Any plans to implement a call-back system on your reFlight Booking Problems line? Been on hold for over an hour now...
@SouthwestAir I need your help but no one will pick up the phone.

@SouthwestAir how often are airplane seats/tray tables cleaned and sanitized? rather have air purifier and clean seats than #wifi 
@SouthwestAir I lost my luggage. My birthday wish is to find my luggage.
@SouthwestAir Been sitting outside our gate for 30 mins at LGA. Why no move to another gate? We'e baking on this plane!?! flight #3415
@southwestair Grand total from landing to getting bag: one hour. That's very sad.
@southwestair Your staff was really kind about the flight delay. Luggage? Not at all. Very disappointing.
@southwestair Landed an hour Late Flight from IND to DEN, and 40+ min Late Flightr, our bags are not here. Not cool.
@SouthwestAir Horrible experience ever with airline..Have to reconsider any future flights. Customer service ... http://t.co/EczHcmM5vi
@SouthwestAir wanting a ⭐️ for the ✈️ finding the gate. No apology or exp. All good, I'm sure connecting flight leaving SAC will be chill!
@SouthwestAir sucks. Passengers leaving the plane to make room luggage, checking luggage and getting back on. Delayed flights to same city.
@SouthwestAir flight to San Diego is delayed per usual.. take me home!
@SouthwestAir every other city on your nationwide sale has fabulous fares. Why nothing from Buffalo? except for 2 cities?
@SouthwestAir not sure why we are still here in Dallas.  Plane has been at gate for 30 min.  No update at all.  Flight 1140, poor service.
@SouthwestAir Loved one's flight ATL to IND Cancelled Flightled due to ""ice in Indy"". Sitting here in Indy, it is bone dry. Tomorrow 4-6"" of snow.
@SouthwestAir I'm in line at the airport right now. Will you cover hotel fair or am I to sleep in the airport?
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight and I'm stranded in St. Louis. Not sure what to do. No other flight until tomorrow. Am I to sleep in airpt
@SouthwestAir - stuck on the runway, again. Delayed on Wednesday. Not a good way to take care of your loyal customers.
@SouthwestAir we're doing our best; sitting at a gate waiting (while not being given information why we're delayed) isn't making this easy
@SouthwestAir my parents flight frm STL2ATL Cancelled Flighted 2nite. When's the next one out?!
@SouthwestAir well my mom called earlier and you guys had her on hold for close to an hour
@SouthwestAir there's an hour wait here for reFlight Booking Problems in line at Omaha.

@SouthwestAir is that the same reliable system couldn't find my info and then said it refund my credit card ?
@SouthwestAir 14 hours????  Sorry don't get it. Oh well. Screw the weekend in Az right?  Eat the hotel, no problem.
@SouthwestAir I am absolutely sick of 300s and no wifi!

@SouthwestAir http://t.co/tTXRSyNLxr doesn't work on my flight. Just fyi.
@SouthwestAir not sure I can trust a statement with that many small numbers above words. http://t.co/o3sRL1hfho
@SouthwestAir Late Flightly you've always been Late Flight! Please get back to the old #SWA!!
@SouthwestAir Totally sucks that my flights were weathered out of existence, but Stacy in Tucson helped with an overnight in Vegas!
@SouthwestAir are you guys alive? i've been on hold for 25 minutes and counting.....
@SouthwestAir Gary Kelly should be ashamed of himself running a corporation in this way
@SouthwestAir you guys just rip me off if I could Cancelled Flight every flight I had booked for my employees I  would Buyer beware
@SouthwestAir just want the money I paid for early bird refunded. Noone seemed to be able at three different. SW should have that worked out
@SouthwestAir I filled in the form on the website too. Darn it all. I guess I'll just have to cross my fingers.
@SouthwestAir heyo! What is causing flight 1836 ewr to hou to be delayed?
@SouthwestAir Your wifi stinks. I'm not mad, but i wouldn't hate it if i got my money refunded.
@SouthwestAir I was on hold for 30 minutes &amp; no one knows how to win these tickets that you're still handing out? #DestinationDragons
@SouthwestAir  after 38 minutes on the phone I'm given another number to call now still on hold with them. http://t.co/1ZT2kEe8up

@SouthwestAir thanks for losing my luggage
@SouthwestAir well I HAD a car &amp; free place 2 stay had I known Unacceptable treatment from Spvsr. Sally in Cleveland. #Disappointed
@SouthwestAir and this asshole cut in front of me. Your system blows. http://t.co/7ujt8VTCpa
@SouthwestAir it's pretty stupid and I probably won't fly it again. Plus hearing nightmare stories of overbooked flights.
@SouthwestAir  over 15 minutes without talking to a human at what point would you recommend I call @AmericanAir http://t.co/ysqbVq6Mgb
@SouthwestAir so u guys Cancelled Flight #bna flights &amp; don't bother 2 alert passengers? What gives?
@SouthwestAir Was going for the weekend for friend's birthday, so no point in reFlight Booking Problems.
@SouthwestAir one of my bags didn't make it to my destination. I have the claim ticket. Any way to help out with a status on the location?
@SouthwestAir yes but not with out an attitude and nasty comment
@SouthwestAir 4 hour delay in ATL due to ""air traffic control""....love missing an entire day of my vacation #unhappycustomer #mytimeismoney
@SouthwestAir#4569 Cancelled Flightled, had to get refund. Cancelled Flightlations happen. But the 25+ min phone wait &amp; painful music unacceptable. Come on...
@SouthwestAir again another ride SW employee that printed out boarding passes. Deficiency in training obviously
@SouthwestAir Apparently mechanics had to be flown in to fix some planes...not the most assuring sign
@SouthwestAir did you Cancelled Flight ALL flights into BNA today??? #needtogethome
@SouthwestAir flights from sunny SFO delayed for hours and others Cancelled Flightled left and right with little updates. Any help @SouthwestAir?
@SouthwestAir Please explain to reps, ignoring a technical issue and passing the buck is not a good business model. Lucky limited to 140
@SouthwestAir understood. Just frustrating, you buy early bird check on the day they go on sale at 6:30am and get mid 'b'. Feel ripped off.
@SouthwestAir Flying now from JAX to DEN and I paid $8 for wifi that barely is functional.  Couldn't do work if I wanted to.  Never again.
@SouthwestAir Flight to Nashville was Cancelled Flightled. How do we another flight? I've been trying to call &amp; cannot get a human
@SouthwestAir delay is understandable but look at the time of the the flight and boarding time. Weird!
@SouthwestAir very frustrated. Bought early bird at 6:30am on day tickets were released and got mid-B ticket. Spend $50 for nothing
@SouthwestAir so, when your plane doesn't work the luxuries I paid for go away but you keep my money? I need that biz model.
@SouthwestAir you will extend if I call the day it expires.why can't it just be extended now?#mightmismybrosgraduation
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flighting flights 45 minutes before takeoff &amp; sitting for 45 min on the runway of the rescheduled flight #badservice
@SouthwestAir - 800 is not int'l friendly
@SouthwestAir 4-4 in horrible customer service. Empty seats in early flight wantcharge me double to get home early instead the usual Late Flight
@SouthwestAir can you answer the phone so I can change my flight plans. Srsly.
@SouthwestAir if you are going to be inconsistent enforcing your rules, I'd prefer you not randomly take it out on freq flyers that obey
@SouthwestAir what does relay concerns really mean &amp; how/why do u keep letting people on flights with bags larger than u state are allowabl?
@SouthwestAir how long does it take for points from RR Shopping to post to my account? Got email saying I've earned points but don't see em
@SouthwestAir couldn't make flight, funds forfeited as a no show!! Was trying to book another flight using those funds, I'm out.
@SouthwestAir make this delay go away. Maybe upgrade me and Kats seats. We are headed to Columbus.
@SouthwestAir FJBFSC  all I need is receipt showing the 776.20 charge I have on my Amex not the 656.xx that I keep getting sent
@SouthwestAir  getting the run around today with customer service &amp; disconnected customer relations # given twice. Help!!!
@SouthwestAir you were my go to airline now not so much!! You say you care but I now see not so much! Right now, you suck!!
@SouthwestAir I have been loyal to Southwest from the beginning but very unhappy about your devaluation.
@SouthwestAir  Longer flights with 300 series no wifi? Will be great when you retire them.
@southwestair excruciatingly slow internet on SWA flights is now the norm, rather than the exception. Is this being addressed?
@SouthwestAir The in-browser hover over is intrusive and annoying. And the fact that the WiFi only works on one device is sort of sad.
@SouthwestAir the sign in screen had major mobile issues, the responsive design wasn't working properly my Nexus 5.
@SouthwestAir sure did. Also read on there that Southwest doesn't believe it is liable for the incident. How is it my fault that SW lost it?
@SouthwestAir What's up with the new in-flight WiFi service? Super crappy user experience. Miss the old provider. :(
@SouthwestAir Repeating this is policy is basically repeating ""Fuck you"" to your customers. I'll be shopping for a new airline ASAP
@SouthwestAir yeah... that's not what happened. I'm really pissed. This is the kind of thing I expect from US or Austrian, not you.
@SouthwestAir  Glad to see you know how to keep the money in your own pockets. 'Thanks' for the voucher in return for lost bag.
@SouthwestAir you call this customer service?? Sitting in the tarmack for 1hr, lost bag, and you give me a $100. voucher???
@SouthwestAir that's bull. Once you add a fare to the cart you should be locked in. I made it all the way to PayPal.
@SouthwestAir having trouble with Wifi. No matter what I get redirected back to getconnected page even though it says I'm connected.
@Southwestair is this account even aware of the #destinationdragons contest? The one youre fucking up for me?
@SouthwestAir What does this even mean?  I'm taking about letting elite customers who paid for a seat fill a seat that will go empty anyway.
@SouthwestAir you do a great job of achieving that at most cities, just not at BWI.
@SouthwestAir hello. my flight is Cancelled Flightled for #destinationdragons and no one at your desk at KCI knows what the fuck is happening!!!!!!!!
@Southwestair thanks for leaving me hanging here. #destinationdragons flights all fucked up now. No help?!
@southwestair three flights with three  check in agents, not enough. #missedflight  back to Jet Blue
@SouthwestAir unable to book travel right now on the website or through the app. Help!
@SouthwestAir turned my non-stop flight between Laguardia/dal into a 1 stop in STL. WTH? I'm thinking some sorta comp is in order? REALLY?
@SouthwestAir my sinuses had to contend with two painful landings rather than one, and we missed a preregistration window. Beyond frustrated
@SouthwestAir #delayed again! You're killing me Late Flightly!
@SouthwestAir Another delay. Wow
@SouthwestAir I don't want to be too whiny. We accommodated several passengers whose earlier flight was Cancelled Flightled. Our flight was very long.
@SouthwestAir I can't begin to tell you how slow my plane's wifi is. I can't even pull up an email.  What am i paying $8 for??
@SouthwestAir We should be landing at RIC right now, but haven't even left ATL. Should have picked Delta maybe?
@SouthwestAir I love ya but your bringin me down. An hour Late Flight leaving and now we've been sitting in the runway for 20 min  #fail
@SouthwestAir I have never been mor e disappointed in a company, charging $8 to use your wifi which only works for about 8 apps parhetic
@SouthwestAir  Just picked up my bag at SEATAC all the clothes are soaking wet... #bagawim http://t.co/nGxAl9OmL6
@SouthwestAir offering us absolutely nothing for our troubles either. Blames the @TSA
@SouthwestAir link doesn't work
@southwestair after 4 hours of delays you did make a nice offer for rescheduling me the next day... but...
@SouthwestAir Paid for in flight wifi from Austin to San Diego - wasn't useable. :/ Possible to get a refund? Conf #8X7XVM
@SouthwestAir I figured the streaming wouldn't work per the TOS but just the @NASCAR site is taking longer than 5 minutes to load
@SouthwestAir now we have to wait, and wait to get it straight. I fly you for personal and business. But now, not so sure. #BeBetter
@SouthwestAir because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. This messed up the passenger log.
@SouthwestAir Your #Android Wi-Fi experience is terrible! $8 is a ripoff! I can't get to @NASCAR or MRN for @DISupdates #BudweiserDuels
@SouthwestAir Dear SWA, I fly you a lot.   Most of the time, amazing. Today: unacceptable.I am sitting here in Midway delayed 20 min....
@SouthwestAir, what do you know? Finally lined up like cattle to board my SW flight (after original departure time) #badcustomerservice
@SouthwestAir where is the great customer service I have come to know/expect; you LUV dropped by EB check in and no help in sight!
@SouthwestAir why can't you help me after you made mistake and dropped my early bird check in on your end?  Where is the LUV?
@SouthwestAir is seriously THE WORST. I don't remember the last time I or someone I knew had a flight that wasn't delayed / Cancelled Flightled / etc!
@SouthwestAir why do you charge so much moving from a full flight to an earlier flight with seats available?  doesn't make sense to me.
@SouthwestAir and now no wifi??? Come on.
@SouthwestAir on brd now.frustrated we go 2 #BUF not #ROC.if tld flt was gng 2b held earlier would not be a mess.cng bk unable due to overbk
@SouthwestAir, on #unscheduled aircraft change, please have a better system in place, not worth the paid upgrade. #REFUND
@SouthwestAir love how you hold flight 2851 in PHX for Late Flight passengers and make us all over an hour Late Flight. Great job.
@SouthwestAir I tried to return to orig booked flt. told overbooked.Gng to diff dest.Feel like we were switched on purpose bec of overbook.
@SouthwestAir do we have a time estimate for our luggage? we'll be sure to fill out your survey!!
@SouthwestAir, remember me? Wouldn't let me on 3:05pm flight (seats available). Now my 7:40 flight is delayed. Worst airline. #badservice
@SouthwestAir yall say flt 4200 is on time, yet we haven't boarded for a 3:35 departure b/c we are waiting on a new crew. Why the subterfuge
@SouthwestAir my Flt was delayed, scheduled to miss my connection, can I get some help? 8HH4P2
@SouthwestAir I didn't say anything about patience, I said this is probably the last time I fly Southwest. I suggest others do the same.
@SouthwestAir don't ever tweet me again
@SouthwestAir Problem is, I wasn't issued a position until today at the gate. And no option to upgrade. Not good when you're 6'4.
@SouthwestAir might be the worst airline ever
@SouthwestAir My 11AM was canned. I empathize. But I think your Team has lost the right to be capitalized. It's a lowercase team day.
@SouthwestAir Oops...no functioning bathrooms on a fairly full flight?  Hope everyone on 702 from New York can hold it.  Me included.
@SouthwestAir I tried again with your in-flight wifi #fail
@SouthwestAir you're killing me!! always #delayed from #SanDiego to #SF!! #ugh
@SouthwestAir almost bumped me off my flight to HRL when I was 20 minutes early then your staff was rude when I asked what was the problem?
@SouthwestAir why doesn't your terminal B in LGA have pre-check? Makes me want to never fly your airline
@SouthwestAir Why can't I find a cheap flight from DC to St Louis? The prices went up like crazy for April weekends!
@SouthwestAir Unable to check in my flight. It says my itinerary is ineligible for checkin online. Go to counter. Very inconvenient!!!
@SouthwestAir thanks a lot for sending a ""special deal"" with @Budget. Getting screwed is the best when on vacation #sarcasm get new partners
@SouthwestAir for your loyal A-list customers it should be easier to get help and bring resolution to issues with your rewards program.
@SouthwestAir Yes. Please train your customer service agents with correct protocol.. I should not be receiving different 411 evrytime I call
@SouthwestAir never got any notification that flight 955 was Cancelled Flighted today. Correct phone # and email on file. Not a happy customer.
@SouthwestAir suggestion- shades on the windows @KCIAirport so travelers won't have to watch ur luggage handlers throwing their bags around
@SouthwestAir your A-list program is a complete JOKE! Your company does not value loyal customers.Time to look for another ""go-to"" airliner
@SouthwestAir What's with the pricing cache?! About to book a flight, refreshed the page, &amp; the price jumped from $73 to $159. Ridiculous. 
@SouthwestAir A-List Pref credit card holder called exclusive # and hung up after on hold for 14 min. What gives???
@SouthwestAir Is your BWI-SJD service seasonal? Wasn't part of extension. Called intl desk. They didn't know. Want to fly in Sept on Sat.
@SouthwestAir  3 flights yesterday; no treats but nuts and pretzels. Also no origami in the magazine. New policies? #OldPoliciesWayBetter
@SouthwestAir is awful. They have lost my bag and aren't providing any info. This is day 3 and nothing. #WORSTAIRLINEEVER
@SouthwestAir if this flight is Cancelled Flighted or delayed any further I expect full compensation for my park ticket, hotel &amp; flight..
@SouthwestAir there is a good chance myself nor anyone else in this airport will ever be Flight Booking Problems southwest again..
@SouthwestAir and YOUR costumer service representative lied to me and ensured me the plane would be leaving by 330.. It's scheduled for 455
@SouthwestAir not to mention I now have to sit in the airport for 4 hours. You've ruined my trip. I am not happy and want compensation.
@SouthwestAir you need to get your act together. You new this morning at 830 our plane was malfunctioning. Yet I've been delayed 3 times ..
@SouthwestAir Report was filed but would like to support some active searching.  Feels pretty passive now.  Info on computer is precious.
@SouthwestAir surprise surprise more delays. Seems to be the norm.  Broken down equipment.
@southwestair this inflight WIFI is the absolute worst. I'd be willing to have paid double for dialup speeds...  #Flight7
@SouthwestAir I pay for a service to be delivered. Whether or not it is your fault shouldn't there be some sort of compensation?
@SouthwestAir A little surprised my Early Bird got me B15 from DEN to KC just now. Worst I've had. What's up?
@SouthwestAir, got ""duped"" w/ a connection on 1st flight (sneaky), now u won't give me a seat on an earlier flight w/ availability. Shameful
@SouthwestAir, real sincere apology! Makes my day! Glad to know flying mail is more important than me. Never flying SW again! #badservice
@SouthwestAir, rude customer svc, won't accommodate an earlier flight w/o $400 charge. US Mail takes priority over customers. #badservice
@SouthwestAir RUDE gate agent. Wholly unacceptable to us &amp; other passengers. Think this will be our last time on sw.
@SouthwestAir having trouble reFlight Booking Problems a Cancelled Flighted flight. no one picking up phones and your site isn't working.
@SouthwestAir please hire an efficiency consultant to manage your PHX baggage checkin. Way to many open kiosks with 100's of ppl waiting
@SouthwestAir Every flight flown by me personally(about two round trips per month) is FULL. Still hard to believe. Fly 8 hours thru ATL?NO
@SouthwestAir . I don't like the new schedule. No more nonstops from PHL to FLL or PBI? We are not free to move between those cities. Sad.
@SouthwestAir Incredibly frustrating. I emailed but still haven't received a response.
@SouthwestAir I paid for inflight wifi only for it not to work. Download speed was 0.21mbps &amp; I ended up watching the free TV instead.
@SouthwestAir I wish I would've known so I could've slept 2 hours more and let my friend know not to wait for me after she lands...
@SouthwestAir nothing express about your express bag drop at Phoenix Sky Harbor
@SouthwestAir Is there an email address I can send some thoughts to? This experience was really not good &amp; I have some feedback.
@SouthwestAir great. My flight is delayed three hours. Now my friend has to wait for me at the airport for hours on her birthday. 
@SouthwestAir is main supporter of play where Jesus is portrayed as homosexual partner of Judas and who performs a “gay wedding” #boycott
@SouthwestAir you're giving everyone tix for #DestinationDragons except for me and it's during my birthday!!!!
@SouthwestAir well, it was fun while it lasted. Not happy about the change to redeeming reward points. Won't be loyal anymore.
@SouthwestAir why the delay on Flight 423 BDL to MCO? Need to get to Florida for the ☀️&amp; races in Daytona
@SouthwestAir I'm getting leathery from the heat on 4251 before I even get to Vegas....
@SouthwestAir my first flight ever and flight #4251 is already having technical issues. Faaaannntastic.
@SouthwestAir Stuck on 4251 with the heat blasting to try and thaw the water lines.... Kinda disappointed for my first flight as a RR member
@SouthwestAir love how ""friendly"" your staff is when asking for updates on delayed flights causing missed connections. #horribleattitudes
@SouthwestAir hates guitar players. Chgd for oversize AND extra bag on my acoustic guitar. Epic fail.
@SouthwestAir I spoke to soon... My bag was lost.. :(
@SouthwestAir humor aside, we've been stuck on the plane for two hours at the gate because bags can't be loaded correctly. What gives?
@SouthwestAir We've been sitting at the gate for two hours waiting for bags to be loaded... I'm telling Herb.
@SouthwestAir had a very rude gate agent at BWI tonight gate B8 after a 6.5hr delay for flight 1172. I think a little training is in order.
@SouthwestAir flight Cancelled Flighted tonight and was told I won't receive a travel voucher for the inconvenience. Is that really your policy?
@SouthwestAir today you sporadically changed my flight departure 5 times &amp; left two hours Late Flight. Uncharacteristic of u http://t.co/TXhYJ40llG
@SouthwestAir Yes - with extra $77. I wonder what are you going yo loose, if there is room.
@SouthwestAir I am going to stop flying with you.  Delays everytime.  This time due to paperwork?
@SouthwestAir I receive bad customer service and ended up spending several hundred dollars to accommodate my family during each cxl flight
@SouthwestAir it keeps saying that mobile boarding passes are unavailable despite having checked in and everything
@SouthwestAir your app isnt working and i take off in like two hours help
@SouthwestAir I understand weather is not your fault, but as a frequent flyer I expected better customer service. I'll be trying @Delta
@SouthwestAir doesn't even have gluten free peanuts. whyyy me??
@SouthwestAir it took ages for one snapchat story to load. one. ONE. I will demolish you
@SouthwestAir your WiFi is shit. fix that up before I jump out of the closest bloody fucking emergency exit.
@SouthwestAir We need help changing a name on a company reservation....We tried calling customer relations but there is a busy signal.
@SouthwestAir So frustrated with my experience with #Southwest. 18 hours trapped in Denver bc of mechanical problems. #worstcustomerservice
@SouthwestAir we've now lost a whole day of our honeymoon... Very disappointed and frustrated with everything.
@SouthwestAir was wondering is there a reason why customer service is so busy? Been on hold past few days for many hours No answer Help plz
@SouthwestAir Open more kiosks at 
Austin-Bergstrom. Three lanes to service a line of 50 people? Really?
@SouthwestAir A-list preferred line phone wait was 15 minutes. I hung up, not feeling A-list-ey!
@SouthwestAir I'm miserable on your Orlando to Vegas nonstop right now. How big must a guest be for u to require 2 seats?  I'm in 1A btw.
@SouthwestAir doesn't want to deal with me, but the world might want to know how they are treating their customers: http://t.co/sKKewqhssG
@SouthwestAir So I guess you can get to the airport too early!  Need to wait 10mins to checkin. Really?
@SouthwestAir #worstthingever 2days Late Flightr our lost bag was fedexed somewhere. Do you know where cause we don't &amp; it was delivered somewhere
@SouthwestAir why would I want to when the last time I did, you screwed me out of my early boarding that I PAID FOR.
@SouthwestAir #JamesAsworth has the worst corporate account manager #22 Brent. I will now take my 70plus flights to @Delta thank you
@SouthwestAir, a complete horror show. Flights bumped three times today, before noon, not how to run an airline. #cantblametheweather.
5 hour delay = shortly?“@SouthwestAir: @brendanpshannon Brendan, we are so sorry to keep you waiting. We'll have you in the air shortly!^RS”
@SouthwestAir step 1: be less shot. Step 2: acknowledge customers other places than Twitter. Step 3: don't suck so much
@SouthwestAir I'm sorry for straying and going with @AmericanAir I've learned my lesson. These attendants need some SW happiness!
@SouthwestAir it's the poor customer service that I have a problem with!!!!!
.@SouthwestAir 3 days &amp; still not home. Not even off the ground. 3. Days. #PastMyPatienceExpirationDate
@SouthwestAir Just OH-ing a text message I received from an entitled jackass of a friend.
@SouthwestAir now it's delayed until 3:55. Getting yelled at by attendants not to bother them. Getting worse
@SouthwestAir Service rep didn't say I was dumb just had the tone of voice like I should have known about it.
@SouthwestAir it would be nice if I could talk to an agent rather than get caught up w/ a promotion &amp; then be hung up on
@SouthwestAir I just wanted Southwest to know that I don't think they're as great as I used to anymore. Nothing to look into.
@SouthwestAir Customer relations line had busy signal too, called the normal line and the service rep thought I was dumb for not knowing.
@SouthwestAir Didn't see travel had to be compete for unused funds by expiration date hidden in the fine print. Never saw that before.
@SouthwestAir when will sw return to customer service?  Business travelers made sw now sw ignores us.
@SouthwestAir your app repeatedly crashed and failed to display my name when checking in. Was unable to use app. http://t.co/0kN7PjelZL
@SouthwestAir boarded plane only to be told to get off as it wasn't our plane. Now an hour delay. 
@southwestair TWO hours on the plane at the gate?!? This is undignified behavior for you. And the apology isn’t enough. #freedrinkcoupons
@SouthwestAir she cut people off 35 minutes before flight time to check in bags, for a flight that was delayed 2 hours! I waited 8 more hrs!
@SouthwestAir Hi! Just got my TSA pre-check # &amp; put it in my acct. But it's not on my boarding pass for a flight this p.m.Can it be updated?
@southwestair really?!? 1.5 hours ON THE PLANE and at the gate??? Jax2BNA. Like we haven’t waited days to get home #notokay
@SouthwestAir Lastly, for a company that's trying to put the love in flying it would be nice to have someone personally address my concerns.
@SouthwestAir Therefore, since I've received no recourse through phone I have submitted an email complaint &amp; a letter via mail will follow.
@SouthwestAir I consider myself a loyal customer to the brand but I'm astounded at the lack of concern about customer's flying experiences.
@SouthwestAir This experience was the worse flying experience I've ever had. To be met w/ contempt from your Customer Service makes it worse
@SouthwestAir All I requested was a refund of my Reward Points that I used to purchase the flight and he refused.
@SouthwestAir So today I call into Customer Service &amp; speak with Wendell Holton in the Dallas office &amp; I am told there is nothing he can do
@SouthwestAir We did not get a single answer from any Southwest personnel. After an hour's wait. No apologies, no explanation.
@SouthwestAir I, along with other passengers repeatedly asked Southwest personnel what was taking so long, where was our luggage.
@SouthwestAir Next once we arrived to Atlanta, we waited a full HOUR before our luggage was placed on a carousel. One hour!
@SouthwestAir Secondly, we did not begin boarding on time despite our aircraft being present and deplaned. Thus we left over 30 min Late Flight
@SouthwestAir First there were cockroaches crawling on the counter at the gate and visible mouse traps under the seats at the gate
@SouthwestAir I am completely displeased with the service I received on yesterday flying from LGA to ATL.
@SouthwestAir FS4VE7 when I corrected the attendants error she gave me attitude made a rude show of taking back nuts&amp; said ""well i was Late Flight""
@SouthwestAir I just sent a screen shot of the incident report.
@SouthwestAir Flight 4110 MCO to ISP delayed. Any details on why?
@SouthwestAir  flight at 630 from fll kiosk just opened. Rude attendants because now everyone is Late Flight. http://t.co/2Boh2Mh3cb
@SouthwestAir why is your website downnnnn :( ugh
@SouthwestAir Had a bad experience with them last week.  They broke my bicycle that I had brought with me to do a bike ride in Fla.  Why?
“@SouthwestAir: @TinaIsBack I'm so sorry for your frustration. Did you get rebooked? ^SW” I've been rebooked 4 times!! Still stuck!! #SMH
@SouthwestAir 75 minutes and still waiting for skis to be unloaded. You should be ashamed. It's 1:30 in the morning.
@SouthwestAir where are our bags?
We have a tv show to film!!
@SouthwestAir I am scheduled for the morning, 2 days after the fact, yes..not sure why my evening flight was the only one Cancelled Flightled
@SouthwestAir update 35 minutes into this pilot has turned off a/c. No longer freezing, but we are enjoying waiting for reload of all bags
@SouthwestAir It seems odd to be sitting on a plane that gets further delayed and you find out by txt, not the 6 emp working on the aircraft
@SouthwestAir really enjoying sitting at BWI with the door wide open and the a/c on as they fix a ""baggage error"" #sarcasm
@SouthwestAir Engadget Theverge Wired reddit
@southwestair,  Your male flight attendants must being playing a game called Who can be the Bigger Dick to People. Flight 952 to CHI-MID
@SouthwestAir when you're on hold with southwest for over 2 hours and it automatically hangs up on you. #iusedtoloveu http://t.co/tEFHpuWMdJ
@SouthwestAir this was the 3rd Cancelled Flightlation in 2 days due to weather in Nashville. 3 trips to the airport. Each time communicated Late Flight by SW
@SouthwestAir I left my iPad on my flight 1831 from ERW to DEN. I opened claim 442998. It has so many memories on it. Plz help get it back.
@SouthwestAir   Yes. Dale at Baggage office was wonderful. But not everyone is on the same page down there... We had a 6 hour wait!
@SouthwestAir No one wants to commit to saying if this plane is getting Cancelled Flighted or not. Customer relations is closed. Patience gone.
@SouthwestAir  Tried to leave Monday, all other planes left but mine. Now this one keeps getting delayed. Missed work. Have to pay for a cab
@SouthwestAir My luggage has still not been found. Luggage is not scanned until final destination. So no way of knowing where it is!
@SouthwestAir Finally got through after 3 hours and all set. Thanks.
@SouthwestAir I did ....it's just been such a disheartening experience for me and my family...and a lot of taxi money wasted.
@SouthwestAir please help on hold forever to check in for flight
@SouthwestAir my sister and her family had to drive 1200 miles because you did not accommodate a rebook in a timely manner! HORRIBLE
@SouthwestAir can't believe how many paying customers you left high and dry with no reason for flight Cancelled Flightlations Monday out of BDL! Wow.
.@SouthwestAir I appreciate that, and not to be rude, but it doesn't solve much. You should AT LEAST cover the cost of stolen goods.
@SouthwestAir you're 4/4 on blowing it with your customer service. Shotwest Airlines.
@SouthwestAir she made it standby after her flight was Cancelled Flighted for no reason. Almost 4hrs Late Flight.  Conf# FVF9YW  SWRR# 298033455
@SouthwestAir very frustrated with your customer service.Open seats on earlier flight, $154 to change. What a rip off!!
@SouthwestAir no self help way to put in tsa pre check number for existing reservation. Very annoying. 800 is not reachable.
@SouthwestAir Why won't you let me leave Newark!?
@SouthwestAir I was in Nashville and I had to drive 3 and a half hours to Memphis, but I made it as the plane was loading!
@SouthwestAir According to TV passenger interviews, the landing was far from ""uneventful"" with heavy (panic) breaking to
@SouthwestAir what are the chances you will be Cancelled Flighting all flights in and out of Nashville again?
@SouthwestAir  why are you the only airlines to Cancelled Flight all flights into BNA? Been stranded in philly for 2 days. Hoping to get out in the AM
@SouthwestAir thanks, but they told him he couldn’t a few hours ago, then my plane left  after I tried to do it. Stuck waiting for hours now
@SouthwestAir took our BOS to BWI plane for a flight to StL and promised a replacement  1.5 hours Late Flightr. Now 2.5 hours delayed. Not happy.
@SouthwestAir even with the 50$ voucher for picking up my bag
@SouthwestAir there... from my first interaction with your people this morning, after bad weather, sorry but I wont be flying with you again
@SouthwestAir yeah they told me it would be on the next flight. I drove down and it wasnt. I just drove down for a second time and they were
@SouthwestAir I hope you're happy! You have officially become the next @AmericanAir #ProfitBeforePeople IMO you will be bankrupt by 2020
@SouthwestAir what's up with these delays?! Throw some priority boarding my way &amp; I'll forgive you!!  #southwest #southwestairlines
@SouthwestAir needed my flight info so I can add my rapid rewards to my flight ... First time I have flown with SW - won't do it again #mad
@SouthwestAir Being old I will miss my connection and can sleep at OAK or get a hotel on my own dime rubs me the wrong way. I wasn’t Late Flight.

@SouthwestAir sadly didn't get much help ... As a travel agent this is so disappointing to me.

@SouthwestAir can you make a premium wifi that I can pay $30 for that is decent? #slow-fi
@SouthwestAir extremely #disappointed with poor the customer service provided after Cancelled Flighting my flight today! #unprofessional
@SouthwestAir I was helped by a nice lady at PHX checkin. I spent 4 hours on hold in 24 hours, so might want to look at efficiency there.
@SouthwestAir I told myself last time I would never fly you again. I really messed up today. Thanks flight 1802. Worst airline ever
@SouthwestAir not as sorry as I was when I sat on a plane for 3 hours waiting for the engine to be fixed and THEN got my luggage lost, but k
@SouthwestAir I do need help Cancelled Flighting my flight back. Your calls times are ridiculous.
@SouthwestAir your customer service is terrible, you're terrible, thought you should know.
@SouthwestAir You officially have the worst customer service of any airline I've ever dealt with. #southwestairlines #poor
@SouthwestAir Fastest response all day. Hour on the phone: never got off hold. Hour in line: never got to the Flight Booking Problems desk.
@SouthwestAir had to rebook through Atlanta &amp; now drive to #Nashville. Had to pay ridiculous price difference. Bad weather good for business

@SouthwestAir too Late Flight now
@SouthwestAir Yes but they couldn't explain the 2 hour and 45 minute hold time.
@SouthwestAir MCO-&gt;DCA flight almost full of people screwed by the MSY-DCA Cancelled Flightation. @united and @USAirways didn't Cancelled Flight. SWA=mistake.
@SouthwestAir 4/9/14, I need to fly from GSP to DSM, but claims there's no sched. avail.  I can book separately, but why not together?
@SouthwestAir Thank you - hung up after 1hr 7min on hold. Would you like me to DM you contact info?
@SouthwestAir your checkin system is #poor
@SouthwestAir WiFi on yesterday's flight extremely slow a waste of $8 and lost the travel time for work.
@SouthwestAir still on the ground &gt;30mins after planned departure. And this is California. No weather here. Originally told 10 min delay.
@SouthwestAir How? It is not possible to call SWA on the phone. You put me on hold for an hour and then cut me off.
@SouthwestAir been on the phone for about an hour waiting..can you please answer, Thank You!  #notcool
@SouthwestAir flight #211pilot spilled his tea on the radio! Yay for delays! Almost an hour now!
@SouthwestAir used to love you, but you keep rescheduling my flights.  #southworst
@SouthwestAir where do we start? I've already wasted 1.5 hrs of phone wait time already :-(

@SouthwestAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight to BNA. I have flight from BNA 2 MDW tomorrow AM. You stranded me in DEN. I've been on hold all day
@SouthwestAir good thing we noticed because she had re-routed 7 total passengers on an impossible triple connection as well
@SouthwestAir your gate agent re-routed an impossible itinerary and we had to find a new airline to get us home. Super bummed about this
@SouthwestAir do you do auto callbacks so I don't have to wait on hold?
@SouthwestAir Received email w/reso's to my email that isn't associated to SWA account I own with CC info for my sister. #FRAUD please DM me
@SouthwestAir Your onboard wifi is so bad it's taking me 20 minutes to send this tweet.  Working is off the table. #disappointed

@SouthwestAir - I have spent 87 minutes (and counting) on hold w/ you today. After first 48 minutes, I gave up. Trying again &amp; on 43rd min.
@SouthwestAir Ive had on an airline. Everyone else has been great but she soured the whole experience for me. Hope she's not there next time
@SouthwestAir the woman working the counter in philly at 630 this am needs to be fired. Due to bad weather, I along with other passengers
@SouthwestAir was earlier, for reFlight Booking Problems flight I'm on now. Didn't get a screencap, just said ""unspecified error"" and to call SWA
@SouthwestAir Buying Early Bird was pointless. You moved me to a diff flight b/c first one was delayed, so I lost my boarding position.
@SouthwestAir is there a problem with the website? I tried making changes w/ the app and the site but got ""unspecified errors""
@SouthwestAir super disappointed today. First time we've had to stress and now book a flight on another airline while at the airport
@SouthwestAir Hey SWAir- a very tortured boarding on flight 1971 due to one gate agent having to board assisted folks one at a time.
@SouthwestAir I understand a delay but to be stuck on the plane longer than the flight is unacceptable
@SouthwestAir in my 30 years of flying I have never been so pissed off.  To many incidents for just one flight.
@SouthwestAir Heard apology ~45 times in the &gt;60 mins I was on hold. Now flying from another airport at a different time but delayed AGAIN
@SouthwestAir I will.make sure to tell everyone I know about this all around horrible experience. I will also post it on my business page.
@SouthwestAir and currently as im bringing my 3 year old to the bathroom I'm being rushed by the flight attendant.
@SouthwestAir not terribly inspired to call ""customer service"" in the future now.
@SouthwestAir also, they said they couldn't even book the flight. They were having to put me on hold &amp; have someone else do it???
@SouthwestAir how about when there are Cancelled Flightlations you just have a link to rebook like you did for initial storm issues?
@SouthwestAir there really should not be guidance to call via phone if you are that back logged. I could have done it online in 3 minutes.
@SouthwestAir Almost 2 hours on hold now. I just need to Cancelled Flight a flight and get a refund. Other airlines are operating!
@SouthwestAir You need to be more accommodating to your loyal customers. Not happy now!
@SouthwestAir @BernhardtJH I did eventually get through but that flight Cancelled Flightled.  Decided to drive but gave up holding to process refund
@SouthwestAir worst customer service, Terrible attitudes. I don't care how big a storm.  Your employees need an attitude adjustment
@SouthwestAir Flight Cancelled Flightled out of BNA.... Do I have to reschedule now or can travel funds be put back into my account for future use?
@SouthwestAir are you kidding me?  I needed help yesterday. I'm now landed and waiting for my connection.  Never will I fly southwest again!

@SouthwestAir I also find it ridiculous that I've been tweeting to you since 3:50 AM EST and have still received no response. 9 hours?
@southwestair Thanks. Yes I got through. Biggest frustration is that I'm no longer able to check in online for my flight after 4 Cancelled Flights.
@SouthwestAir why are flights still getting out of Logan now? You couldn't manage to get one out at 6 AM, when it wasn't snowing!
@SouthwestAir 45mins wait on the phone with no option for a callback? Finally had to hang up because my phone was dying. #customerservice

@SouthwestAir @challemann flying to LGA in the dead of winter? #jvstatus EWR &amp; JFK is always the intelligent option.
@SouthwestAir I need to reschedule a flight and I've been on hold for almost an hour. This is ridiculous. Is there a best number to call?

@SouthwestAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, reFlight Booking Problems online has not worked, on my second round of hold (3 hrs now). Any other options?
@SouthwestAir do you not try to get customers to their destinations? No help to get on another airline if you had no flights for 3 days?
@SouthwestAir I'm an A-list Preferred customer and very loyal SWA. However, your inflight wifi is no better today than it was 4 years ago.
@SouthwestAir too bad I'm getting this memo: ""Your reservation contains modifications that prevent you from changing it online."" #FUSTURATED
@SouthwestAir almost 2 hours on hold, 2 hours of my life I can't get back.... Thanks http://t.co/IyUZM2PUVS

@SouthwestAir We have been stuck in SJU for several hours and no one is answering here. Really tough to LUV SW. No response is bad.
@SouthwestAir you guys there? Are we on hour 2 of our phone hold at 3am bc of volume or short staffing?
@SouthwestAir its cool that my bags take a bit longer, dont give me baggage blue balls-turn the carousel on, tell me it's coming, then not.
@JetBlue They weren't on any flight, they just came Late Flight. Your JetBlue employee just informed us!
@JetBlue everyone is here but our pilots are no where to be found and my last flight the plane was dirty that I had to clean my area &amp; seat!
@JetBlue Hey guys, why did my last flight earn me 0 pts? http://t.co/1syWlmTZek
@JetBlue 2 aisles of empty #evermoreroom seats and we can't move bc we didn't pay?! #nonsense #Waste #JetBlue #jetbluebos #cheap
@JetBlue they booked me for tomorrow. It's $250 higher. My 1st reservation is PGFRYZ. Get me on standby list 4 tonight would help.
@JetBlue but by Cancelled Flighting my flight and pushing me to the next day I'd lose $150 hotel which was why I was trying to get a same-day flight.
@JetBlue Cancelled Flighted my flight. Went with another airline 2 leave 2day. They Cancelled Flighted also. Called JetBlue &amp; got same flight but now $250 more
@JetBlue just wondering if the website is having issues today. Trying to book a flight with my visa I always use and its rejecting it.
@JetBlue upset with the lack of communication we've received for our ""on time"" flight 1170 out of MCO
@JetBlue I've spent three hours talking to all different people, most of which couldn't help. I probably won't be using JetBlue again.
@JetBlue I had to call back five times to get someone on the phone who knew what they were doing. By that time my getaway went up by $200.
@JetBlue Are there really no flights from the Bay Area to Chicago anymore? Lame. So lame.

@JetBlue why was Flight 1856 delayed to Buffalo ?  It’s a direct flight and the plane is at the gate.
@JetBlue we are missing our connecting transportation in Puerto Rico as a result. Need to get to Vieques today.
@JetBlue we were supposed to be Vieques by 3pm
@JetBlue your customer service today was deplorable.  There were plenty of ways u could have gotten us on that flight. #badcustomerservice
@JetBlue why do this to me sending N598JB to UVF today and its a weekday why not a weekend :'(
@JetBlue service getting worse and worse. Plane can't fly waiting on a 2nd aircraft. So much for planning.
@JetBlue no seat assignment 5 mins before a flight...line 20 people deep. Guess I'm sitting with the baggage? @MarinaDomine
@JetBlue the worst flying experience I've ever suffered through. I'd appreciate my money back.
@JetBlue my wife sent me a family invite but I never accepted it. She should not be locked into a family account that never got created.
@JetBlue we have. Twice. They said they can't dim those lights. But they did on our first flight.
@JetBlue we would have been up in the air by now. Now our new plane we've been redirected to has mechanical errors aka more delays 2/3
@JetBlue you delay all my flights. Then you redirect my gate. Then you tell me had we stuck with the original gate we would have 1/3
@JetBlue - Definitely no note from whoever stole from me.
@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
@JetBlue - I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people's bags? Security cameras? Anything?
@JetBlue - I did, but since I was stranded in SYR without a ride I missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter. (4 hours)
@JetBlue absolutely no worries. I'm just never flying with you again. Ever. Even I have to hitch hike cross country #passengersarepeople
@JetBlue if I had made as many mistakes as you in as short a period of time. I would I have lost my job at this point!!!
@JetBlue I understand why ur doing it. But for someone who just traveled 2+ hours to get here early. Relax b4 flight etc. Adv notice maybe??
@JetBlue not one of my four flights this trip has been on time. What the he'll is your companies problem?
@JetBlue @DatingRev mco to lag two hour delay and sitting in Tarmac going on 40 minutes with infants crying on plane!! Get us off this plane
@JetBlue what maintenance?  The flight landed from Jamaica, has to go through security then get to term 3 then cleaned then board
@JetBlue that's not a answer!
@JetBlue there were seats but after waiting on hold for 20 minutes they were gone-now she has to stay another night in charleston-very pricy
@JetBlue not ok to Cancelled Flight flight 1274 tmrw for ""weather"" &amp; to rebook 4 flight the next day when there is flight tmrw night. no compensation?
@JetBlue I guess you weren't able to do anything to improve the time.. and now it looks even Late Flightr.. going to be a #zombie tomorrow
@JetBlue Am I the only one who had to look that up? I must be getting old...
 #damn
@JetBlue flight for tomorrow morning Cancelled Flighted &amp; can't seem to rebook me. They can't even get me a seat. No clear answer on why Cancelled Flighted.
@JetBlue Gotcha... but ""lessening the delay"" ... that part's not happening, right?
@jetblue any idea what caused the delay on flight 1316 FLL &gt; Jax ?
@JetBlue once again my flight is delayed. I hope I dont miss my  connecting. Please don't fuck me... I have a girlfriend -_-
@JetBlue three hours on s delayed flight staring a blank screen. At least a heads up so you could download a movie
@jetblue I hate you for this  https://t.co/g4WwR6VBRQ
@JetBlue you really should be more proactive with passengers when you know the entertainment system isn't working. At least let me get a mag
@JetBlue We had some major plane-wide DirectTV issues yesterday. System kept being reset by crew member.
@JetBlue Not helping since there's a bunch of us trying to get off at the same time.
@JetBlue we haven't even gotten off the plane yet! I can't afford to miss my flight back to Boston! Ugh.
@JetBlue We just landed in Vegas but not allowed to leave the plane just yet. Thanks for making me miss my flight at 1 pm. #fustrated
I hate you all. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/uTdfqF5WPA
@JetBlue @TatianaKing @thewayoftheid I feel only a few free travel vouchers will assuage my indignation.
@JetBlue You respond to complaints about cultural appropriation with more of it!?  You're  now below Spirit Airlines on my fly list.
@JetBlue @martysg Spoke to Corp. Customer Support already.  Shame.  Probably a reasonable and cheaper resolution to be had.  Regards
We didn't need this. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/cpZB285o71
@JetBlue any info on why flight 704 from SJU to JFK is already delayed 2 1/2 hours?
@JetBlue I'm sick of y'all.
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/5xGnyHGAFz” this is what I hate
No no no bad airline bad! *bops you with newspaper* “@JetBlue: @maatkare67 We hope you're still our bae! @TatianaKing @thewayoftheid”
delete your account @JetBlue
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/8o3SCR5EFW” smh yall expect me to trust a childish airline with my life? #Nah
.@JetBlue this is enough for me to stop flying JetBlue.
STOP. USING.THIS.WORD. IF. YOU'RE. A. COMPANY. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Fd2TNYcTrB
But, are your flight attendants fucking tho? RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/wGYzTnjCXm
@JetBlue no. Please stop.
@JetBlue well, now I'll make sure to never fly JetBlue
@JetBlue Sure did go south after breakfast though! Delayed three hours. :( :( :(
@JetBlue someone should screen what you play on your flights. http://t.co/tNY9uIpha5
@JetBlue For one way, not letting me select TO city....strange...and now some fairs look ""normal"" ????
@JetBlue great job getting flight 28 in 10 minutes early. Too bad we're at 50 minutes and counting waiting for our bags.
@JetBlue I believe it's Irina. On the flip-side, super disappointed that EatUp Cafe isn't available on this BOS --&gt; SFO flight today.
@JetBlue All good, I just have 2 remind myself that if this was 1914 I might be on a horse &amp; buggy. So what's a little delay right.
@JetBlue Unhappy with 4 hour delayed flight.. Missed dinner
@JetBlue  Called JB 3 times!Everytime, Auto Vmsg:""your wait time should not be longer than 9 mins"" waited longer than 18 mins and no answer!
@JetBlue All correct for rates Boston to Pittsburgh wknd March 14? Rates all of a sudden took off! Made plans, came back to buy &amp; surprised.
@JetBlue nope. The ""regular"" line was multi-x faster. You literally direct all the wheelchairs and strollers into the same line as EMS.
@JetBlue Understood but I watched as fam heading to FL was expedited when they had 25m to takeoff. I am speaking at conference in SF
@JetBlue  any effort to fix your points system? 11 days and a call to customer service and still no account update. Chasing points is no fun
@JetBlue I tried! Had me running from curb-side to self-check &amp; wasting even more time. Ended up Flight Booking Problems United for $$$, am so upset
@JetBlue keeps getting better. No water on the plane.
@JetBlue I don't want JetBlue +TV. I want JetBlue +WIFI :(((
@JetBlue what is the deal with flt 460 today? Departure keeps changing. When is it going why is it so Late Flight?
@JetBlue lol at your ""estimated departure time."" Plane hasn't even started boarding yet. You can't even get your delays right.
@JetBlue 653. Just for update that gate got moved to complete opposite end of the terminal. Airline is a disaster.
@JetBlue no I asked. Either way it doesn't make the flight less delayed.
@JetBlue shocker my flight delayed an hour. Thanks for reminding me why I switched to delta.
@JetBlue Are you having any issues with online check-in? My colleague and I are getting ""Webpage not available"" after submitting online form
@jetblue are going to let Fl382 into a gate in BOS any time soon? We're just sittin' here on the tarmac  waiting.
@JetBlue not an issue but I think training &amp; information would help. Great ppl but service needs to switch from individual to group better
@JetBlue is so sloooooow today
@jetblue terrible landing on 915
@JetBlue Woo! Update! Flight 915 is now possibly delayed by more than 2hrs!  Power of positive thinking, people.
@JetBlue Didn't find out my flight for NY, scheduled to leave at 9:30pm, is delayed by more than 1.5hrs until AFTER checking in. Huge fail.
@jetblue - WTF, stuck at JFK for 2+ hrs in a delay to Boston cuz u say snow.  No snow on weather map!!!  WTF!!!
@JetBlue 2 words: ""staff training."" What a joke-
@JetBlue is a joke. Missed my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Last flight of the day and they don't hold it.  5 minutes.
@JetBlue Very disappointed with the lack of compassion from your baggage services dept. I nearly had to beg get just for a ""courtesy report""
@JetBlue over 2 hour delay going from NYC to Denver! Come on man!
@JetBlue @amybruni @DIRECTTV No Oscars on Direct TV on this flight. We were so looking forward to it. We were devastated. :-/
@JetBlue - Fix your @#$&amp; jet bridges.  40 minute delay, 2nd gate...still waiting!  #jetblues http://t.co/ncB2oNcS9i
@JetBlue didn't work. Fly-fi plus couldn't access ABC app. So I spent $19 and still missed Oscars. #disappointed
@JetBlue Safety might be your priority but organization clearly is not.
@JetBlue #611 from JFK to LAS still delayed?
@JetBlue the lack of TV made it rough, that's literally why I picked y'all over the competitors.
@JetBlue But not reddit? I work for the site and this is ridiculous.
@JetBlue i only take jetblue to travel and i have to go to maimi next year but you guys dont go to maimi why dont you guys go to maimi???
@JetBlue aka take stuff out of the checked bag! Then just carry on the extra weight. For someone just had shoulder surgery that's just no
@JetBlue ""Goodwill"" now at $125.00.  $27,000 x ? = Fine   Still want your new CEO to make a public apology to all passengers of flight 136
@JetBlue hard when you're with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane. We should get better than this
@JetBlue even tho the extra 5 lbs are still going on the plane, just as a carry on. Where is the sense? What do you say to fat people?
@JetBlue I thought being a mosaic member had 'perks' the best part is instead of checking the extra 5lbs I'm carrying it on 
@JetBlue are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days? You went from $50 to $120 for overweight fees! Outrageous
@JetBlue ill call in the morning. too upset right now.
@JetBlue im still waiting??? No answer!!
@JetBlue the amount of money I spent on hotels for a WEEK bc of flight Cancelled Flightlation, another flight doesn't make up for the money lost.
@JetBlue being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can't be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice
@JetBlue by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk.
Keep Waiting, time does not cost anything for @JetBlue hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback http://t.co/Ji2pg4gom9
@JetBlue Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems?
@JetBlue I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed
@JetBlue after boarding flight 0510, the captain informs that he could exceed the16 hrs regulation and turned the plane around. Incredible!
@JetBlue @julesdameron ""Considering?"" #Accessibility is an absolute MUST! #Equality
@JetBlue how do we watch the oscars though right now?! No abc on flight :( #missingtheoscars
@JetBlue 2nd time in a row a flight out of jfk a disaster. Last time I wasn't allowed to fly stndby, now a 2 hour delay w/out notification
@JetBlue oh right! Me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in SDQ http://t.co/7gB0hgW51t
@JetBlue. A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What's going on?
@jetblue I'm dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight 0510 in Santo Domingo have been treated. 9hrs to board the plane and no info given
@JetBlue  I did.  They have no idea where it is.
@JetBlue thanks but still annoying. Especially if I miss my flight.  Can I tweet at the TSA??
@JetBlue hey JetBlue.  Still waiting to hear where you lost my 9'8"" surfboard between JFK and BQN airports.
@JetBlue well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility http://t.co/ML1JaCpmch
@JetBlue flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc?
@JetBlue your crew didn't say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers
@JetBlue you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether
@JetBlue I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue
@JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG
@JetBlue that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp; being told by 3 ppl to wait &amp; they'd come back but did not.
@JetBlue 4 hr delay on flight to JFK via Tampa &amp; worst customer service in San Juan airport. This after app not working all day.
@JetBlue just please get my luggage from #2070 onto carousel 5 / Logan Airport and I'll be able to go home!
@JetBlue what happens when I have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for Even More Space upgrades?
@JetBlue thanks for the response. Just been waiting for 5 hours and really frustrated. Seems like no one at JetBlue is concerned.
@JetBlue thank you for not even coming with a solution. Great service I might say...as a TrueBlue member I am totally dissatisfied...thanks
@JetBlue how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of PBI to make up for 2.5 hr delay? Treat us right.
@JetBlue why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem?
@JetBlue WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won't be on this flight unless I pay more.
@JetBlue I hope your customer service reps are as reliable/friendly as they usually are, so far you are not living up to your + rep/exper.
@JetBlue last flight was Cancelled Flightled, then it was 2 hours to change a light bulb, now sitting here waiting for maintenance. Unreal.
@JetBlue I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight..
@Jetblue  I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!!
@JetBlue I think it's safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #JetBlue flying we are officially DONE. #Byebyejetblue
@JetBlue anything serious I should worry about?
@JetBlue Why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you??  #jetbluefail http://t.co/v8SB0RBICx
@JetBlue Seriously, what is your solution? Who exactly will help my 5 year old if there's a problem with the plane? http://t.co/vPDRPLXj5a
@JetBlue Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don't tell me you were snowbound in PBI.
@JetBlue This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there's a problem? #jetblue http://t.co/LAiGgef9Kj
@JetBlue, thanks for not guarantee that you can not deli ever my bags to my hotel, when bag missed connection. #sFO #customerservicenot
@JetBlue you're lucky we're still flying you after today's landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids!
@JetBlue so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied?
@JetBlue if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don't quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail
@JetBlue they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your ""terms"" response is insulting.  #jetblue
@JetBlue What's your excuse this time for 1117 delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air.
@JetBlue if you can't guarantee parents will sit with their children, don't sell tickets with that promise! #jetblue http://t.co/HDoXiM6NZ2
@JetBlue kids fly. Don't hire people who don't care about them. This guy. #jetblue http://t.co/clvlhfgUZw
@JetBlue I shouldn't be made to feel like a criminal because I want to sit near my 5 year old on a flight. #jetblue http://t.co/qgtCao1J2U
@JetBlue why would you hire a guy who doesn't care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. http://t.co/lKFh9HYHW8
@JetBlue what's up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting.
@JetBlue from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex  JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you're still nothing
@JetBlue Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you.
@JetBlue you've let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven
@JetBlue a 5 year old can't sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick. #jetblue http://t.co/2HXsDP0ha4
@JetBlue being told by this guy that he will not help us sit next to our 5 and 8 year old on the flight. #jetblue http://t.co/49FLbgzZkd
@JetBlue thanks for NOT! Sending me an update that our flight was delayed 3 hours. Unbelievable!
@JetBlue 5 hours delayed now in hour increments?  Really?  &amp; as Mosaic I still have to pay $25 to use lounge during this waste of a Sunday?
@JetBlue @amybruni No wifi on this flight so we can't tweet you our Oscar party pics at 37,000ft. #bluecarpet :-( SEA✈️BOS
@JetBlue Thank you for the reply. Would've appreciated communication before checking in about the delay. JetBlue used to be my go-to
@JetBlue You also promised to change my wife's name on the account and it is also not done.  WTF?
@JetBlue You guys really suck! I just spent 40 minutes on the phone linking my credits to my account.  They are still NOT there! 1/2
@JetBlue Good perspective. If only this safety concern had been expressed at some point before I arrived at the airport. #communicationiskey
@JetBlue exactly why is my flight delayed? 599 BDL to DCA? Can't seem to get an answer
@JetBlue You left 175 PEOPLE on a hot plane with no ventilation for over an hour and a half and then had to bus them to JFK because of ....
@JetBlue You just don't get it.  It's not about the money, It's about PEOPLE!!!! How about a public apology from the president of Jet Blue.
@JetBlue why, when you book a flight now, does jetblue separate a 3yr old from the mother? Isn't that a bit stupid? check-in headaches!
@JetBlue You never got my wife to her destination and you expect a $75.00 ""goodwill credit"" will  make everything hunky-dory. You blew it.
@JetBlue every time I look at the flight status, 30 more minutes is added to the delay. How about some points for trouble??
@JetBlue hey awesome peeps, what's up with flight 1159 from Boston? Delayed 3hrs?
@JetBlue Flights 1384 and 1583. I have picked up twice this week for 1583, and both times it was delayed!! 
@JetBlue What's up with delays to and from Boston today? My sister is trying to go home, and bro-in-law trying to come to RDU. Craziness!
@JetBlue now we dont have enough money for parking in your garage this is your fault and im not paying for what should be 10mins into 3hrs
@JetBlue I waited 3 hrs for my bags and my flight was only 2 hrs
@JetBlue backlog is an hour at most, this is over two!  Unacceptable!!
@JetBlue your agent told us TSA didn't have a crew to get bags!
@JetBlue no baggage crew update!  Your staff is incompetent with no answers after 2 hours....
@JetBlue is blaming @TSA for flight 584 luggage debacle!  #luggagegate
@JetBlue You failed. That's the answer. Please don't justify otherwise.
@JetBlue come on! Already delayed 2+ hrs on flight 1415 as we waited for the pilot to come from Boston, now you reassign him?! Endless trip.
@JetBlue When I got your alert, I immediately started looking to rebook. But we only had 11 minutes from reFlight Booking Problems to catch a flight to SRQ.
@JetBlue  I shouldn't have to find them, they should tell us. I've flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn't what it was.
@JetBlue If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don't buy it.
@JetBlue I don't believe so. That's not what the team has told us.
@JetBlue also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight.
@JetBlue #1691 out of JFK. no one has info &amp; no answers as to why we boarded the plane. the team is in an awkward spot &amp; everyone is cranky
@jetblue  Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections.  Please help!
@JetBlue Something to think about when you are dealing with PEOPLE!!!!!  Just wrong.  No excuses. Figure it out &amp; expect the unexpected
@JetBlue I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO
@JetBlue what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!
@JetBlue My wife was with our dog.  They wouldn't even let her out off the plane.  My daughter was at Newburgh lives close by. So wrong
@JetBlue According to your ground staff, it hasn't even been taken off the plane yet!
.@JetBlue thanks for making an effort. Credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours. #fwiw #loweredexpectations
@JetBlue At what time?  All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong
@JetBlue flight delayed at JFK 2 hours, then 3 hours, then 8.5 hours? Now it's back to 5 hours with no explanation or apology?
@JetBlue Flight 1562 had a 4 1/2 hour weather delay, but what is the 45 minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers?
@JetBlue 5hrs on Tarmac yest b4 Cancelled Flight @12am.Today 3+ hr delay. Why not send txt/email re: JFK closed &amp; saved all trip 2 sit @airport again?
@JetBlue flying out of BUF 2 BOS, missing captain... Really? Delayed til 2:00... Not happy...
@jetblue, it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed.
@JetBlue I know, but I wanted to pass it along. Not good for the ""T5 experience"" esp for someone who flies 2-3 times a month.
@JetBlue So what about the plane stuck in Newburgh won't start.  It that weather reLate Flightd as well.  These passengers on plane for 10 hrs.
@JetBlue thanks. Home to MSY. TSA precheck agents directing people after photo until scan beyond rude. One grabbed and pushed children.
@JetBlue, your hold music sucks.
@JetBlue no excuse though for 3 gate changes though.
@JetBlue get me home! Flight 2016 from buf to Bos is missing a captain!? Really!?
@JetBlue nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can't believe I paid money for this.
@JetBlue @CookJaycook123 the only update we get is that they have no idea when we will get an update. Way to go. #hopeless
@JetBlue @Amagrino will you cover the cost of my car service waiting time?!
@JetBlue waiting at HPN on plane more than an hour since landing b/c of no gate, please get us off this plane!
@JetBlue too Late Flight. Several passengers are inebriated. You're in league with big alcohol. Shame on you.
@JetBlue thanks for making my vacation not worth it again... Currently waiting on the runway for another hour to DEPLANE
@JetBlue letting me down in San Fran. No Media rate? What's the deal? Looks like this is the last time I fly anywhere with you.
@JetBlue and have empty ""help"" desks
@JetBlue there was a closure? People here need to inform passengers, not send them gate to gate w no info on boards re: updated departures
@JetBlue Flight 1533 JFK to Cartagena all at this airport bar singing the opposite of your praises! We're making a pact to never fly u again
@JetBlue what happened to our plane meant to leave @ 830? Why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? Seems organizational error not weather.
@JetBlue really not acceptable. Just informed plane won't start. Chartering bus to take passengers to jfk.
@JetBlue u guys have 2b kidding. No help anywhere. 5 hour delays? Still no answers. Bad cust service. #idlovetoask http://t.co/DPX3yoGTEj
@JetBlue unfortunately I was so startled and rushed, I didn't get the name, but will provide a description in my expanded email.  Thank you
@JetBlue it's sunny and gorgeous in ny actually. What's the real reason?
@JetBlue it's been 3 hours, why have you not sent the plane from the hangar for flight 1533 at JFK? This is absolutely ridiculous.
@JetBlue still sitting in plane in Newburg. This is getting #ridiculous. No way to treat #loyal customers.
@JetBlue what's the delay if the system isn't down?
@JetBlue don't think any1 rly knows what's goin on. supposed 2 leave at 8:30a then 9a then 9:30a then 10a then 11a then 11:30a. Now 12
@JetBlue That is not very gracious of @jetblue to tell me where I can go BUY water or a snack when our flight is delayed over 3 hours.
@JetBlue after applying my new tag, she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt..I had to walk back 50 yards
@JetBlue That's not weather reLate Flightd.  You are just being nice and blaming the weather.  Airport just wasn't prepared. Investigation time.
@JetBlue It's not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate
@JetBlue she waved someone behind me to step forward although I explained what happened and indicated my need to make my flight
@JetBlue #489. Flight #589 is departing before we even board
@JetBlue here's part: was at bag drop inserted my JetBlue cc, didn't print pass. Agent standing in front of me refused to print my pass
@JetBlue That's not what I heard. Weather was fine this morning. Flight 136 was circling for some time.Someone forgot to clean the runway.
@JetBlue When it's 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as ""on time"" #updateyourwebsite #489
@JetBlue how can your entire system go down? No IT? Really?
@JetBlue Appreciate the heads up at 10:45 that my 11am flight was delayed bc the crew is stuck in Boston #communicationFAIL #dobetterJetBlue
@JetBlue seriously? System down? No IT?
@JetBlue just had a horrible experience with check in agent at fort myers, I'll document and send details, off to Boston
@JetBlue flt1533 to Carta what is goin on?! 1st told plane coming from hangar, then gate change, now no one knows wat plane we're getting on
@JetBlue isn't this something YOU should do?!  Why should I tell your crew how to do their job?
@JetBlue your app needs updating. Says my flight is on time when we are well past boarding time with 2hr delay http://t.co/BTvpxTZJu0
@JetBlue Are there airport-wide delays at BOS or did we just get unlucky with 152?
@JetBlue woulda been nice of you to let us know that or post it!!! Your boards still show the flight on time!!!
@JetBlue flt 136 from PHX. Delayed 2 hrs, circle 1 hr, divert to upstate NY, just sitting for 1 hr No communication #horrible
@jetblue all your online resources  say we're on time, but clearly we are not.  This is not very information age of you...
@JetBlue ..... No crew at our gate.
@JetBlue why don't YOU tell them to update the boards?!
@JetBlue Issue is JFK. Pilot explained once JFK reopens we can get scheduled back there, but why can't we divert to LGA? Closer than ACY!
@JetBlue you want me to talk to the wall?
@JetBlue Its poor Flight management. There is   no reason why a scheduled 8:00  pm  flight to takr off At 11:00pm .
@JetBlue why is my 910 flight listed on time when its 904AM and I'm not on the plane yet? http://t.co/iEG2ObcEpp
@JetBlue @fllairport best way to kill nine hours at the airport when all flights are full and the airline won't put you standby? #stranded
@JetBlue won't see my money again after their poor service    should have stuck with virgin america what was i thinking trying jetblue???
@JetBlue suck and their customer services are the worst  whats the point of having a loyalty scheme that they don't honor #badairline
@JetBlue well they said Cancelled Flight on the PA system. Guess they are trying to get a plane from Boston. And not a 100%  confirmed
@JetBlue that's where we all get on the same page. Cancelled Flighted it 45 mins ago. @delta @SouthwestAir help flights from @tfgreenairport to MCO?
@JetBlue my flight 475 Cancelled Flighted due to lavatory problems. Can't confirm if they are gonna get a flight from Boston Logan Int
@JetBlue some woman stole my seat on the plane but I was the one that had to sit elsewhere. Is that standard protocol?
@JetBlue full the six of us had to leave flight. And now have to wait a whole day to get a flight and my kids will miss school.
@JetBlue no. Not boarding order. Someone boarded with. Service Animal which a member of my party was allergic to and because the flight was
@JetBlue it's ridiculous that I just got home and I was supposed to land 3 hours ago bc I am HELLA tired
@JetBlue just lost very loyal customers who use them 4-10 times a year.
@JetBlue Highlight of my travel is 3 hour delay and de-icing twice. Now sitting in bumper to bumper traffic in taxi to finally get home. 
@JetBlue a voucher.. I can't believe I took this risk. Not only was the plane terribly filthy and I had 15 screaming babies in my face..
@JetBlue I've spoken 2/emailed JB team and explained situation. Didnt seem to matter to anyone other than me. I guess I just expected more.
@JetBlue Shocked by misbehavior and cheap comments from jet airways staff to passenger at Delhi Airport Friday boarding to Dubai. Disgusting
@JetBlue you have to service your remote controllers on my flight I watched equalizer (movie) THREE times because my remote was stuck
@JetBlue @dgruber1700  oh wow and I'm complaining about two hour on the run way shucks JetBlue NOT GOOD your service was better than this
@JetBlue I'm curious to know how do you compensate for passengers missing engagements due to a two hour wait on the tar-mat to get to a gate
@JetBlue everytime I come back to Boston it's a minimum 45 min wait for bags. Earlier it was almost an hour. Why is it only Boston jetblue?
@JetBlue that is not what your employee at Logan told me. I finally got one to meet my daughter on her first solo flight after rude rep :(
@JetBlue flight attendant was hesitant to give me more baby sized cookies
@JetBlue You can pass that along to my wife, daughter, daughter's friend, my elderly mother-in-law.  They spent several hours waiting.
@jetblue I missed a goal On @NHLonNBCSports because of your Inept male stewardess. I should have landed already but I havent taken off yet.
@JetBlue you are doing a horrible job at JFK...you need to rethink how you put these routes together. Unprofessional
@JetBlue can you let me know status of flight #454 PBI-JFK delayed 2.5hours now on board problem with hatch..
@JetBlue Why did you interupt the Staduim Series on @NHLonNBCSports. I dont need to see your stupid commercials or Emergency. Info.
@JetBlue we are well aware. Insufficient info. No options.
@JetBlue just sat on a plane for 3 hours in Dulles #insane #ijustwanttobeinBoston #thanksDC
@JetBlue can we get a honest update on departure of flite 454. Been on plane with infant children
@JetBlue u suck!we have been sitting here for 9hrs because of ur negligence
@JetBlue Complete waste of an entire day. Pathetic.
@JetBlue flight 790 you had us stuck on the plane for nearly 4 hrs. Set to take off only for flight control to deny us. THE WORST SERVICE
@JetBlue she did. she's still waiting on a callback....the lack of follow through is what's concerning. smh
@JetBlue she has...she hasn't heard from anyone in over a week. a nonstop flight and her baggage was lost/stolen. customer service 
@JetBlue we got our luggage after waiting 40 mins and went home right after. Not very family and ADA friendly waiting that long w no chairs.
@JetBlue Flight 2202 out of JFK, 2 &amp; 1/2 hr delay. I could get over it if it was just  weather reLate Flightd, but considering it's not - Come on
@JetBlue we saw one, he was as useless as the tsa agents who inspected my shoes
@JetBlue disappointed with the missed connection from ROC to SLC and no reimbursement even tho friend who is a pilot said it was due to ATC
@JetBlue what crew? No one here is helping.
@JetBlue If this is customer service, then please call me.
@JetBlue no, we are at a hotel.  Also, Jetblue lost my daughters luggage.  How do you lose luggage if the plane never actually left!!!
@JetBlue lipstick on a pig still a pig. Ur new baggage claim @ SJU is a disaster. No chairs, 20 mins+ wait for baggage. #fail
@JetBlue how long does it take for a bag to get to the baggage belt!!!!!#toolong of a wait
@JetBlue we've been delayed and delayed here in Palm beach... Need to head to Westchester. Can you give me some info?
@JetBlue Hey Jetblue, you stranded an entire plane that was supposed to go to JFK and we are getting restless.  Need better communication!
@JetBlue Hey Jetblue, you Cancelled Flightled our flight from ST Maarten to JFK.  Stranded my family in the baggage area and lost my daughters luggage
@JetBlue your website is seriously horrible and so is your  call center!! Almost makes it tempting to fly someone else!! #sodone
@JetBlue why haven't you allowed for flight changes into the NY area airports tonight?  Everyone is saying travel is treacherous.
@JetBlue not cool. At the gate, turns out my flight from FLL to JAX is delayed, yet app says on time. Not a good start.
@JetBlue there is no supervisor available, so they couldn't do anything.
@JetBlue I now learned that customer service at SXM works for the airport, not JetBlue. They need a supervisor to do anything.
@JetBlue - trying to fly from BOS to JFK. Flight delayed. Traveling with kids. Book a hotel or are we getting out tonight?
@JetBlue we tried. They're not at all helpful. Terrible customer service, at this airport, at least.
@JetBlue Tell me at what point will u realize u can't fly into DCA tonight- u Cancelled Flightled the 1pm when will u Cancelled Flight the 5:26
@JetBlue making a bad situation worse. Cancelled Flighted flight, making us stay overnight in SXM. Won't provide vouchers to stay in a different hotel
@JetBlue You already Cancelled Flightled the one b4 us to DCA
@JetBlue It is physically impossible to make it to the airport, and our flight is scheduled to leave in less than 3 hours.
@JetBlue we want room and food allowances. Agents are refusing to give us vouchers to use at rooms we book ourselves.
@JetBlue send more service agents so all the stranded passengers can be helped!!!
@JetBlue hopefully this flight Seattle to Boston 2pm will have wifi. Our first one did not and we had to entertain ourselves! #lizaapproved
@JetBlue as a customer it feels like i should stick to airlines other than jet blue. I travel for my work for past 5 years never seen $70
@JetBlue I've been in pricing for 8 years to know that 70 bucks a seat is criminal. 20-30 I understand. #pricing #flying #jetblue #pricewise
@JetBlue you guys need live chat.
@JetBlue quick ? Why is a person traveling w  a mosaic not get the green tag? Doesn't make sense I end up waitin 4 my sons bag anyway :/
@JetBlue continuing you record of never having a flight leave on time. Add up how much time with with my family you have cost me. #jetblue
@JetBlue I guess I have to redo the Flight Booking Problems. Ugh!
@JetBlue that sucks. Oh well.
@JetBlue she's standing here on her cell no announcements no info #thismosaicnothappy
@JetBlue someone is here but has no info smh one bag came off  and then nothing
@JetBlue can u see what's holding up flt 1002 bags? One bag came out nothing else for 10 minutes
@JetBlue why wouldn't you just credit it right to my account instead of having a separate sign on. That seems pretty ridiculous.
@JetBlue where did my travel bank credit go?  I can't call you right now.
@JetBlue Love your airline...hate your website.  Just tried to book 2 tickets (1 w miles, 1 w/out).  Absolute joke.   Needs a lot of work!
@JetBlue yes, We have de baggage claim, I'm so sad for the baggage and how They treat Us  please we need That baggage
@JetBlue my mom's baggage is lost, in fly 1557 fort lauderdale-Bogotá today, Colombian employees treated us badly , need help please
@JetBlue No changes made. My son's pass printed on same conf #. Just mine not print after I expressed disapptment w/ JetBlue
@JetBlue Cancelled Flighted 
@JetBlue You have very unhappy customer. After waiting 20 min on hold, rude &amp; uncaring rep has now frozen my acct. can't print bdng pass!
@JetBlue the first place but I really didn't need the extra stress at this already terrible time. Oh by the way, I made the flight with 30
@JetBlue that I missed my flight. I had to book this flight extremely last minute due to a family death, there's no excuse for attitude in
@JetBlue serious attitude. I was in the fault for running a tad behind but before she even knew my name or my flight info she ASSURED Me
@JetBlue I fly w/u as much as I can, however your kiosks were broken in SYR and there was 1 woman working the ticket counter.. She had a
@JetBlue NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER. We've waited patiently, not to mention $150 and six months of marathon training, we need 2 be there tmrw.
@JetBlue waiting for a flight to FL for 1/2 marathon tmrw 4 charity. U bumped us 2a Late Flightr flight &amp; then Cancelled FlightLED IT. How can you fix this?
@JetBlue you #fail. Snow coming to DC area. Tried to get on earlier flight. You refused. Now flight 6.5 hours delayed. Greedy and foolish.
@jetblue is the website down? Can't print boarding pass
@JetBlue yeah that's all been done. Define ""incidentals""? How much can I spend on gear so this trip is not a waste?
@JetBlue so you guys lost my bag that had all my ski gear in it. I flew here from NYC to ski. Should I buy new stuff tomorrow? ...
@JetBlue on hold for 30 mins placed on hold then hung up on 2nd time in 2 days Only looking for group rates. BOS-SJU 5-12 to 5-19 10 people
@JetBlue you're customer service is terrible. #NeverAgain #flywhonotblue
@JetBlue now we are delayed until 1:02! This is ridiculous
@JetBlue you're flight attendants suck and are always rude :( 4th bad experience with JetBlue tonight :/
@JetBlue says the person who hasn't been delayed for hours and now sitting on a runway with a wailing baby ;)
@JetBlue flight 672 delayed from 9:30 to 11:47 now, still sitting on runway over 15 minutes so far. Air travel at its best.
@JetBlue 1242 now?! I may cry!
@JetBlue Late Flight again lost almost 3 hours of my bay area weekend not to mention two hours of unnecessary vacation time from work.  #flt348
@JetBlue this is awful! flight out of jfk for our honeymoon is delayed AGAIN until 1225 AM, and we lost money on a hotel now! #delayforwhat?
@JetBlue flight 348 is a freaking nightmare tonight #sittingonthetarmac #delay
@JetBlue whats going on with flight 2034.  Delayed beyond 834.  Shouldnt thre flights switch at that point?
@JetBlue what's up with the broken tv in seat 6F on flight 1818 today? Planned to catch the @cavs game!!! Nooooo
@JetBlue I bein calling JetBlue no respond I leave my number no call back I think JetBlue is loosing a customer
@JetBlue I'm on flt 700 lax to FLL both ppl are sleeping so Id rather not disturb in flight. Tried to dl movie no go http://t.co/Nh2i9ZlzMk
@JetBlue thanks for making me miss an important dinner tonight. 2 hr delay and now 20 min on Tarmac... #worst
@JetBlue I don't have enough hands to count the number of times something like this has delayed my flight with you guys. Very disappointed.
@JetBlue just called that number and left message. Are you at to pass along message to team too?
@JetBlue Any option for luggage assistance on the ground at HPN? Flight 2168 delayed 2+ hours &amp; we will have 2 sleeping kids when we land
@JetBlue can you ask SLC checkin/bag drop if they found a dark blue/blackish fit bit flex? Would've lost it there around 445pm MT
@JetBlue seriously?? What is going on?! http://t.co/mTHM9waObu
@JetBlue any news on flight 122 pbi-boston delay? Can we wait to arrive at airport based on reported 1 and 1/2 hour delay?
@JetBlue were boarding now I'm really not impressed. I've learnt a very valuable lesson .
.@JetBlue yes. Filed a claim and they issued $30 credit as a courtesy. The whole thing seems exceptionally uncourteous to me.
.@JetBlue yes and not boarding at 6:44. Good luck with that. Push wheels up to reality.  Dare you.
@JetBlue I'm a trying ! But I'm tired and getting grumpy !
@JetBlue looks like their inflatable car seats got left on the plane, so I guess they'll be back sometime!! #savethoseseats
@JetBlue Jan 5? That's not summer http://t.co/TpzhjX7Hbt
@JetBlue No, the flight wasn't until 9:51pm, but it's already been delayed.
@JetBlue, why must you always delay my Late Flight night Orlando flights? 
@JetBlue ...second incident of lost baggage.  I sent you a DM.  Thoughts?
@JetBlue maybe announce the delay so we don't sit on the plane on the runway for an hour+ before taking off
@JetBlue flight 691 from bos to Tampa takeoff 40 min Late Flight
@JetBlue Noooo!! Why is our previously direct flight from FLL&gt;SFO diverted to LAS? Now arriving almost 2 hrs Late Flightr. 
@JetBlue can't seem to DM you guys.. JDHADP
@JetBlue Two delays.  A little proactive communication goes a long way. #howhardcanthatreallybe?
@JetBlue poor storm customer service, 1hr takeoff delay waiting for the snack cart, rude steward (no names) and I love you guys. #TrueBlue
@JetBlue before departure, while people who are delayed get up to $200 to compensate their time..
@JetBlue has the worst customer service out of any airline company. #dontflythem
@JetBlue what's up with the random delay on flight 1729? Any chance of it being a false alarm?
@JetBlue I lost a day at the airport and off my trip, I should be compensated for the inconvenience!!!!!
@JetBlue dont really know what that means but this isnt the best first-time-flying-w-a-16mo old experience. likelihood of addtl delays 2nt?
@JetBlue I ❤️ Jetblue but i was on flt 277 from fll to sfo. tke off was over 1 hr Late Flight, div to phx &amp; got in 2 hrs Late Flight. What will be done?
@JetBlue sis and 16 month old nephew are. Last nights flight and this am mega delayed. Now this evening's is starting w delays. Why?
@JetBlue what is going on with your BDL to DCA flights yesterday and today?! Why is every single one getting delayed?
@JetBlue we've been delayed for almost 2 hrs. I take JetBlue because I've had good luck, but today is really frustrating.
@JetBlue something they're not telling us (2)
@JetBlue we've been on the runway for over an hour. Now the water pressure is low and taxiing back for maintenance. #1572
@JetBlue thanks for the heads up about the 2 hour delay #sarcasm #patienceiswearingthin #woof
@jetblue when i sign in into TrueBlue, why do I have to do it twice? happens to everyone around me
@JetBlue mechanical failure isn't Boston' fault.
@JetBlue I’m going to miss a hugely important meeting because of your constant delays #itscostingmeincome
I was a bit steamed in conjunction w/my new 7-hour wait at first, but having sat down and bought a bit of tea, I've settled some @JetBlue
@JetBlue appreciate what you've done on your end to make this right, but still unhappy with initial incident. Will be calling.
Lines may be extra long or security slow, but seems your employees too quick to blame customers who don't arrive 3-4 hours ahead @JetBlue
@JetBlue This is the error message: Paper tickets cannot be serviced on-line.
Please see a JetBlue Crewmember for assistance.
@JetBlue Inconvenience is an understatement. More like torture. Clearly going down the wrong path, JetBlue.
@JetBlue don't just cling on to the safety card. It safety was really an issue, then flight would have landed immediately. .
@JetBlue I waited in line all that time to be told by a crewmember that there's no update until 9:30 #3HrDelay #disappointed
@JetBlue   Phone agents can't see same flights I see online???  Can't change tickets even when I am paying. Very frustrating #jetblue
@JetBlue Why was flight 669 forced to return to NY when there was a malfunction? Why not land in the countless air strips surrounding Chi?
@JetBlue Denver-Boston 2/10 flight 994  and Boston-Denver 2/15 flight 493 (both planes!) visible snack crumbs on seats on all upon boarding
@JetBlue Felt a bit like they were adding insult to injury, since we'll be in terminal 5 for seven hours until the next flight :/
@JetBlue I knew the 3-4 hours sounded odd; missed a flight we hit JFK an hour early for and your gate  attendant told us 3-4 :(
@JetBlue Well being on time is not going to happen now. Safety does come 1at. Looks like I'll have 2 look 4 another flight now #1stTimeFlyer
@JetBlue I hope so. Wanted an early flight to avoid the airport chaos but it's too Late Flight for that!
@JetBlue no updates on anything! All we know is there is an issue with the front wheels being locked.
@JetBlue flight 99 to DCA 2 delays, I'm all for erring on the side of safety but it's an inconvenience to people with connecting flights!!
@JetBlue the slowest boarding process I've ever experienced and rude customer service agents.
@JetBlue needs to get its act together in #PHX
@JetBlue - Yes. Best case scenario I get my gear Late Flight Friday, early Saturday. Camp starts at 6AM tomorrow #toolittletooLate Flight
@JetBlue - In CA for the weekend to attend a training camp; thanks for sending all my gear to FL; looks like this trip is a waste #nothappy
@JetBlue why are you making me stay in JFK until 2 am or Late Flightr? Just let me rebook without making me pay more
@JetBlue why did you just Cancelled Flight flight 670 last minute?!?
@JetBlue I'm sitting on the plane. Too many predictable mechanical problems.  Still onboard. This is getting bad...
@JetBlue on your 1503 flight JFK to PR. They got the doors open on this frigid temperature. #icyflight
@JetBlue #poorservice #poorcommunication #waitingsince 10:51 for bags frm flight 424!!! #jetblue
@JetBlue bags hv been posted on board for flight424 on carsl 4. Now switched to carsl 5. It's comedic watching passengers run frm 1 to othr
@JetBlue where is our luggage?? Flight 424 has been waiting an hour for bags! #jetblue #poorservice
@JetBlue what is going on? We arrived at 10:51pm Not One Bag Has Been Unloaded!! Flight 424
@JetBlue service for baggage at JFK is incomprehensible. No employee knows where our luggage is frM flight 424 LAX to NYC ITS AN HR WAIT NOW
@JetBlue yes of course, before I left the airport. I kept looking but claim is still open.
@JetBlue #669 stewardesses can't work w/o a galley light! Back to NYC to change a light. #fromthefrontseat #jetblueBlues @anku @yaffasolin
@JetBlue I left my apt 10hrs ago to go from Boston to SJC and I'm still NYC. Please bring back the nonstop flight. #jetblueBlues
@jetblue we never received that $15 credit for inoperable tv's on our SFO &gt; JFK flight 2 weeks ago. never got an email...
@JetBlue we now have to get off of the plane and wait another 1-2 hours for someone at the @BuffaloAirport to read the temp. #tired
@JetBlue I appreciate the quick response but how can no one go outside to check temp so we can leave in BUF #currentlysittingontarmac
@JetBlue after 40 mins they tell us they can't check temperature for at least 2 more hours. So it's back to the gate to wait. #mosiacfail
@JetBlue what's going on with flight 669 and how many free trips will I get from this epic inconvenience @anku http://t.co/pEUc0BMij9
@JetBlue the departure time keeps getting Late Flightr.  I'll be lucky if I'm home by 3am
@JetBlue how come you're responding to everyone else and not me #wtf
@JetBlue @lopezlaymari what a patronizing response to a legitimate issue
@JetBlue Yep. 1 hour at Logan. Gangway broke and cabin crew stuck on plane. They just arrived. Passengers request butt massages.
@JetBlue my butt hurts.
@JetBlue took forever for catering to get to my flight, now are very delayed. So ticked off right now.
@JetBlue it is absurd that I have waited more than 45mins because the flight attendant assigned for my flight is Late Flight. You dont have others?
@JetBlue delayed flight bummer
@jetblue well, we're on our way now, but more than half my tv channels are just static. 
@JetBlue what is happening with the flight from FLL to SFO? Why the delay and the reroute?
@JetBlue shut up an turn on the tvs/music
@JetBlue :/ he was trying to take stuff from the under the seat in front of him and bugging out throughout the flight. Didn't feel safe.
@JetBlue I don't want to seem crazy! Have already asked twice!
@JetBlue Sent an email more than 24 hours ago asking a few questions, still no response. Need answers before (hopefully) Flight Booking Problems flight...
@JetBlue all they said was delayed due to mechanical issues. I'm looking for something a little more specific.
@JetBlue on flight 2416 to Orlando...ridiculous that we had to wait for this high school band to board. #notbabysitters #whrsthecoach?
@JetBlue you service agents at MCO are great, but their are not enough of them working right now!
@JetBlue not to get into semantics here but ""by"" means ""within the extent or period of; during"" and it is still technically 2/19 #dictionary
@jetblue is giving me false hope of ever getting home
@JetBlue not cool to announce a flight ""delay"" when everyone is checking in. A 4 hour delay bdl-dca with a staff offering  no help.
@JetBlue what's the hold up with flight 1553? boarding should've taken place 30 minutes ago.
@JetBlue now we are waiting over an half hr for the packages. What's wrong with you guys?? http://t.co/wVGpp3Ymz1
@JetBlue Do your TrueBlue pages not work on Chrome or Safari? I keep getting blank pages when I lick on the TrueBlue tab on your site.
@JetBlue that is my point! They are only offering me a flight the next day and expect me to now pay for a hotel because they Cancelled Flightled.
@JetBlue no they offered the flight (4/19), I paid, then they changed it.This is the 2nd  time you have done this to me. ruins cruise plans
@JetBlue My bag is missing from 1099 landed over 6 hours ago. Help!
@JetBlue Apparently, the substitute pilots for flight #69 from BOS to FLL can't be found. No info is avail from the counter. How about you?
@JetBlue Landed at MCO before 9am and still don't have my bag. You were supposed to give it to Disney's Magical Express this AM.I am livid!
@JetBlue Flight 69 (ha!) - one employee said they were reassigned another said they just left. I just want some warm weather!
@JetBlue You mean take more of my time to write you a physical letter because the fraud department doesn't have email or telephones. Right?
@JetBlue actually they said the fraud issue was never resolved. but why then did they issue me a new ticket of the phone?
@JetBlue I called jet blue to get an explanation, and make sure it would not happen in the future. I was told to write the fraud dept.
@JetBlue But jet blue had Cancelled Flighted my ticket &amp; never reissued it.
@JetBlue has screwed me over for the last time.  @SouthwestAir, glad to give you my business. #JetScrew #AwfulCustomerService
@JetBlue Alternatives?  You have absolutely no respect for loyal customers.  8 years.  No more.  I'm done.
@JetBlue Pooling and gifting are completely different.  I shouldn't have to be charged $375 to send points.  Its disgusting.
@JetBlue doesn't help if I have to fly on specific days
@JetBlue it's noting about me i m perfectly fine it's the attitude and dealings with flyers. Stubborn. Demanding. Unwilling to accommodate.
@JetBlue i am sharing it to the public. I fly 20 times a year and sitting now on the tarmac in fll. Your staff is the worst i ever met.
@JetBlue what's up w flt 4? Brothers fiancé sitting on board for 30mins w tech  issues.
@JetBlue is giving us free movies because apparently the dunkin donuts coffee is a safety hazard. #thingsyoucantmakeup #switch2SBux?
@JetBlue As long as someone remembers to put it on plane right? That was a really lame excuse.Geez @JetBlue can do much better #coffeeneeded
@JetBlue What's up with lack coffee on 7:30AM flight. Was told someone forgot to load coffee onto the plane. What????? #INeedCoffee
@JetBlue i appreciate that. When i flew with you in January the check engine light came on right before take off. Now it is a computer.
@JetBlue How is travel bank credit issued by your company fraud - I acquired credit from family friend Charles Kravitz - see his account
talked to a @JetBlue manager and she offered we pay 3X's in cash what we originally paid #nothanks #jetblue #ripoff #flyunited
@JetBlue Cancelled Flightling tickets for 3 best friends going on vacation and never told us #jetblue #fixthis #ripoff @ZKatcher @bretharold
@JetBlue trying to charge us $550 dollars cash for tickets we paid for months in advance #isthisreal #nevertoldus #jetblue #NeverAgain
@JetBlue Cancelled Flightling flights, sending out tickets, then not telling the buyer... #jetblue how is that allowed?
@JetBlue not making a great first impression on my first flight. 20 minutes before boarding and the gate agent still can't assign me a seat?
@JetBlue loves Cancelled Flightling tickets and not telling their customers #flyunited
@JetBlue tickets were confirmed and sent out. find out today that they Cancelled Flightled our tickets months ago and never sent an email #jetblue
@JetBlue would have been good to know months ago that you Cancelled Flightled our flights leaving tomorrow #telleveryone #jetblue #NeverAgain
@JetBlue rather than trying to resolve customer issues, only options offered were paying cash @ airport or write letter. #JustifyThisSupport
@JetBlue I'm on flight and no booze being served 30 min in... What gives? #lostrevenue #angryandsober #bachelorpartymishap
@JetBlue I've used you guys for 10 years but after this experience I will NEVER EVER use you again.
@JetBlue managers telling us to write a letter because we're upset about our tickets to leave tomorrow getting Cancelled Flightled without any notice
@JetBlue Maybe stop telling people the wrong info on your customer service calls.
@JetBlue customer service was so bad updating my points, once I use my next points, I won't be flying you. Point system is almost a sham.
@JetBlue ruining vacations left and right. Who would have thought an airline can Cancelled Flight tickets without telling the buyer
@JetBlue better find a way to get me to Puerto Rico tomorrow morning besides charging us three times in cash what we originally paid
@JetBlue I spent over an hour of my morning on hold w/ your customer support. I want my confirmed flight to be taken care of
@JetBlue @ZKatcher @bretharold does it look like to we talked to customer service? http://t.co/vYUAnh4Iqr
@JetBlue tells me $130 paid &amp; confirmed flight will now cost me $566.80 CASH ONLY @ airport  22 hours before my flight  #RIPOFF #NoSupport
@JetBlue = WORST. Booked in Oct. w/ email confirm &amp; NEVER INFORMED Cancelled Flightlation. Instructed ""to mail written letter"" http://t.co/c7Kzbvf8h8
@JetBlue No, he didn't have more info. I was more infuriated by the way previous rep treated me. how she can possibly work as a JetBlue rep?
@JetBlue she hung up before I can get name. She took no accountability for keeping me on hold +20min. Next rep was not able to track name
@JetBlue I have been on phone with rep for over 30 min and was transferred after asking not to be. She was the worse rep I ever had
@JetBlue How is it possible the only way to contact your fraud department is mailing a physical letter? No telephone? No email? REALLY??
@JetBlue is flight 51 on 4/24/15 moved back? When I booked it said we arrive 11:31 but now it says 12:08 
@JetBlue case making jackass out me we not allowed do favor say?get right care less!me no out of vacation now true see!am!peter scott
@JetBlue False - agent let us do an extra leg room upgrade for $ but not upgrade to mint. Poor business practices. #badcustomerservice
@JetBlue tried them not helpful. Really dissatisfied with Flight Booking Problems my whole trip with jet blue this time around besides the flights.
@jetblue rqstd upgrade to mint at LAX and was told no because i used points! Why turn down $1600 bcz I used points? #trueblue
@JetBlue flight 577  fll to sfo. No speed line even though I paid for it. No coffee on flight. and my non stop now has an unscheduled stop
@JetBlue Why wasn't a $15 service credit voucher I received for tv not working accepted on my next flight for a pillow?
@JetBlue Every crew member I dealt with in Orlando was incredibly rude. I'm actually pretty disgusted with JetBlue right now.
@JetBlue is it your standard protocol to call security onto a plane for a crying baby?
@JetBlue Finally starting to come out. 40 minutes and no communication is not acceptable. Letting me down today.
@JetBlue Gnight checked in at POS &amp; supervisor was unaware of policy. That sucked having to guide him to the internet. He was v unfriendly
@JetBlue 2 hour delay while sitting on the plane and you still wanna charge me for beer? Nah, I'm good.
@JetBlue your customer services agent Jorge at Orlando International is rude and disrespectful, I never want to deal with your bullshit ever
@JetBlue What happened w/#19 from BOS-SAN? My mother is onboard &amp; the crew was evasive as to why they had to return to BOS the first time.
@JetBlue I want you to pay for my parking fee at Orlando airport because your app told me my moms flight landed at 9:19 and it lied
@JetBlue They told us 10 minutes almost 40 minutes ago.
@JetBlue 1472, FLL to LGA. This is getting old. 4th @JetBlue flight in 2.5 weeks, 4th significant delay.
@JetBlue I just submitted feedback for you @gripeo. Not a good way 2 handle baggage or customers: http://t.co/F6COpX1Fvj
@JetBlue I was believing you for a minute, but we just got delayed for a 3rd time!
@JetBlue third JetBlue flight in less than a week. All Late Flight not for weather.  Reliability going downhill.
@JetBlue why is the buffalo flight so Late Flight?
@JetBlue u suck Big Donkey Balls!
@JetBlue I don't think I'll be testing those waters out on my own dime again.
@JetBlue C'mon now. My flight's delayed annnnnd you can't give me a pick?!? I'm about to tweet at @united or @Delta .......
@JetBlue Headphone jack not working on my flight.
@JetBlue Tried...considerable confusion...no announcement...no sign updates
@JetBlue #JetBlueBOS What's up with luggage for Flt 790 DCA-BOS?  Pax waiting for 30 min for bags...no show. Carousel 6 signs not updating.
@JetBlue They did not have any &amp; asked if I wanted tea. How do you have tea&amp;not coffee? I'm a gold on United &amp; coffee I nvr think 2x about
@JetBlue : ur Wed BWI-BOSTON flights (8pm) really need to be better scheduled! They are almost always delayed!
@JetBlue I'd fly to an airline who actually gave a crap about its fliers outside of generic apologies. Jet Blue is terrible #jetblue
@JetBlue the big board says we aren't leaving until after 8:30 
@JetBlue while I appreciate that you actually responded I travel way too much for you to tell me coffee is not a basic option
@JetBlue, my dads vacation to SXM got delayed a day because of @AmericanAir shoddy service. Earliest FLL &gt; SXM flight? trying to hep him out
@JetBlue I did not report the updated info - don't know how to reach them without a super long wait on hold at your main number.
@JetBlue so why do you put this at the bottom of ur baggage report? For fun? #JetBlue @airlinequality #skytrax http://t.co/tU9JX2jaZN
@JetBlue I am heading to JFK now just on principle alone to deal w my lost &amp; damaged bag. #jetblue #jetbluesucks #jfk #badservice #fail
@JetBlue u now have my gears grinding. The JFK baggage office told me I need to bring the bag back right now if not they will close my claim
@JetBlue U say our safety is our highest priority but that doesn't extend 2 our property? This is totally nuts. http://t.co/xZY7pHKFGR
@JetBlue glad u happy I have my bag but as a traveler I entrusted u w/ my property &amp; u return it damaged &amp; that's the best answer u have?
@JetBlue is the worst. I have to postpone my trip and they can't accommodate guests like @SouthwestAir #NeverAgain
@JetBlue PR-friendly tweets don't help drive accountability. Hope Mr. Hayes takes note.
@JetBlue Only wish your ground operation was as expedient as your Twitter response team! Delay just got extended!
@JetBlue keeps asking me to enter a valid email address. My info is saved and has worked hundreds of times before
@JetBlue can't change it. True blue points and I can't get to a phone
@JetBlue I cheated on you, and I'm sorry. I'll never do it again. @SouthwestAir has given my wife and I the worst start to a honeymoon ever
@JetBlue lots of people scratching heads and looking at screens ignoring passengers
@JetBlue what's going on with 1171 LGA-FLL..poor to no communication from gate agents??
@JetBlue FYI - your android app is set to not be applicable with the Nexus 6 - please fix (its a phone, not a tablet). Cheers!
@JetBlue our #FoodAllergy community. IF you want our continued loyalty, you need to do better than that. Perhaps some training is in (2/3)
@JetBlue insensitive? #FoodAllergies are life-threatening. Unsolicited UNEDUCATED opinions are inappropriate, reckless &amp; dangerous to (1/3)
@JetBlue nope. None to be found
@JetBlue I may need to. I had a 40 minute layover and now have a 15 min delay on my first flight.
@JetBlue I may not make my connection and need to find out my options, yet no one is here.
@JetBlue extra-speed line closed in Tampa. What gives?
@JetBlue would love to respond to link but supervisor tore ticket up and refused to give me names and hid her badge from me
@JetBlue you respond to my friend @LisaPal but you can't respond directly to me
@JetBlue you wanna help out? How about you reimburse the money you cause my band to lose.
@JetBlue ask @j_beatz247 but I teach marketing at a university and will gladly consult on customer service and how NOT to treat passengers.
@JetBlue loves to respond to positive tweets but they ignore problems w/ customers. Just ask NOLA musician @j_beatz247 about that. #shameful
@JetBlue Call was not made by the inflight crew. They in fact asked us why we didn't bring it on.
@JetBlue Disappointed we weren't allowed to bring on an aircraft approved carseat on an empty plane. Not cool.
@JetBlue maybe have a supervisor find out why the international checkin at FTL hasn't moved in 20 minutes yet employees picked up 100 pizza
@JetBlue Third flight in a row for my wife with her TV not working...
@JetBlue what is a personal email that I can contact? I have a complaint that you should know about
@JetBlue WHAT'S UP WITH WEBSITE CAN'T ACCESS FLIGHT INFO
@JetBlue you are missing the point. The flight left an hour Late Flight. Why are you allowed to be that Late Flight, and still charge me $50 and 10hrs?
@JetBlue 2nd time flying jetblue this year and my armrest TV controller doesn't work agian!!and that's the main reason I fly jetblue 
@JetBlue hey you guys remembered lol! But now my BOS flights delayed... And turn the heat down in T5 it feels hotter than PR.
@JetBlue and the 20min line I stood in to drop my bag off?
@JetBlue got txt  40min after sched dpt, saying plane had just arrived @ JFK. Late Flightr txt w/ dpt gate change. Then 9:04 dpt for 7:40 flight.
@JetBlue I was not allowed to drop my bag off for my flight that I was running 10min Late Flight for. Turns out it left over an hour Late Flight.
@JetBlue my son left his iPad on flight 1401 from JFK to FLL on Monday. I called and left message and have no heard back. Seat 25A.
@JetBlue all taken care of .... Other then the dropped call and the total half hour wait #love #jetblue
@JetBlue you stood me up last night, but I'm giving you a second chance. I'm just a boy, tweeting an airline, asking them to fly him home.
@JetBlue waited for 15 min then got disconnect
@JetBlue is I can't make changes on the website am I still charged 25 dollars for using phone
@JetBlue your agents at IAD have compounded this problem by not making any announcements #jetbluemess
@JetBlue just a heads up, this page no longer exists http://t.co/NsJWVTTjGo
@JetBlue they say they have no update. I don't work I don't get paid.  Jet blue has my money but no flight. Argh!
@JetBlue well I'm glad I got up at 5 am so I can sit in an airport.  No place else I'd rather be (not)
@JetBlue why 730 and not 645 as scheduled?
@JetBlue #1408 IAD to JFK still hasn't boarded. What's today's excuse and how am I gonna get to work?
@JetBlue why is t that every time I fly jfk even more speed doesn't work waiting for 10 min #nogood
@JetBlue Clients got ZERO, in 32 years career never thought this was possible.2 suitcases worth thousands of $$ in Italian clothing robbed.
@JetBlue not to mention the fact that we paid extra just to fly jetblue thinking it was the most reliable..
@JetBlue We even went to the airport and were on the phone for hrs and no help at all. Everyone said different things.
@JetBlue People kept saying it was due to weather but there were flights going directly to boston even after our flight.
@JetBlue disappointed that my flight back to boston from PR was Cancelled Flightled,rebooked 4 the next day,delayed that one too, and no compensation
@JetBlue She claimed that she did, but I was not happy with the way I was treated.
@JetBlue ripped my suitcase. I then was yelled at with attitude from Geraldine, your employee at the baggage center.Worst airline= #jetblue
@JetBlue That makes sense. It sucks, though, because now I'll be stuck in the airport for 5+ hours and Late Flight to my meeting.
@JetBlue 6 hour delay. Supposed to land at 9pm now it's 3am. Still not boarding. #EpicFail
@JetBlue I hope your system wasn't hacked cause someone else's passport info was on my reservation &amp; I couldn't get my boarding pass
@JetBlue honestly I’m glad you didn’t Cancelled Flight the flight, just that I’ll be driving home at 3-4 am now. :/
@JetBlue bag just delivered and items have been stolen.  At first look - my Kate spade bag and bottle of spiced rum!  Wtf!!
@JetBlue I'm disappointed my flight was Cancelled Flighted, mostly because I was excited to listen to the song ""I'm Blue"" while flying on JetBlue.
@JetBlue flight delayed 3x(!) and still not taking off on time, &amp; greeting me at my seat (yes it's gum &amp; garbage): http://t.co/n9hmcrJChb
@JetBlue supervisor humiliated us and was uncompromising. We were completely blindsided!
@JetBlue right now completely pissed off
@JetBlue I've had no shampoo, no winter coat no deodorant no flatiron and the rest if my stuff since sat
@JetBlue my SIL bought tix for us to NYC. We were told at the gate that her cc was declined. Supervisor accused us of illegal activity.
@JetBlue dispatcher keeps yelling and hung up on me!
@JetBlue they couldn't do it sun then it was supposed to be mon after 6pm then today from 11 to 3 then from 6 to 8
@JetBlue flight from DCA to BOS has no heat #OhNo #BundleUp #Leastthebeverageswillbecold
“@JetBlue: @Analystdoc Unfortunately that's not an available option with our current system. Sorry guys. That's a certain #fail Fix it plz.
@JetBlue received horrible customer service at LAX on 2/11. Reservation Cancelled Flighted without notification, despite having confirmation number.
@JetBlue flight was Cancelled Flighted. Do I need to file a claim for the $50 credit I'm entitled to per yr bill of rights, or will it just be issued?
@JetBlue Why not just take her info in the beginning and if cut off, call back? We do that in my medical practice. We are frequent flyers :(
@JetBlue Are there issues with the mobile boarding passes? My app keeps crashing when I try accessing. Thanks!
@JetBlue well, your new baggage fees, fare structures and reduced legroom has turned you into every other hated carrier in the US. Congrats
@JetBlue yes, well they are operating outside of your terminal and targeting vulnerable passengers. No better than thieves.
@JetBlue well, now saying our flight is going to be Cancelled Flighted &amp; that by not changing earlier, we missed our chance to get out tomorrow. 1/2
@JetBlue tell your employees that!
@JetBlue even @Citi responded quicker via Twitter when they #fail.... Still on hold, hoping no one books the flight..... @JetBlue #fail
@JetBlue Guys, really bad @JetBlue #fail . Someone better call my wife back to get this handled. 203-382-3312 while she waits on hold....
@JetBlue #fail My wife on the phone asking to switch flight times. In mid switch gets disconnected. Now Cancelled Flightled! No new time! No call back
@JetBlue they tried to have us towed. Do you think I'll be flying out of your terminal again? Risk of $75 fine from corrupt police official
@JetBlue understand that, but this policy of targeting your passengers is not good for business and should be addressed with security
Always been a @JetBlue fan but maybe next time I'll fly @VirginAmerica for real customer service.
@JetBlue the whole plane. Hoping for better luck on the return flight Sunday.
@JetBlue so I'm penalized for packing lightly, having 1 bag and paying extra for a seat?
@JetBlue dropping passengers with small baby and 3 infants at your San Juan terminal. As unloading baby, officer writes me ticket for $75
@JetBlue the TV. Wifi was spotty. It's just a nice feature for a X country flight. Still won't keep us away #lovejetblue
@JetBlue why did I pay for extra space to be forced to put my backpack under my seat? Its my only bag. Flight 135. Unprofessional.
@JetBlue we were on b6 619 this morning from Boston to beautiful San Diego. We really were bummed the satellite was broken. :(
@JetBlue just lost my business   Enjoy your profits
@JetBlue I would drive 2 1/2 hours to jfk to board JetBlue to Vegas instead of closer Hartford airport. Cramming more seats on plane.NO MORE
@JetBlue yes, today. Flight is full now. They said no to me at gate :(
@JetBlue this is not a flight delay this is horrible planning on Jet Blue!!! #jetblue
@JetBlue insane the craziness I've seen with Jet Blue today at Newark Delayed 3 hours and now we are waiting for a Pilot!! #jetblue
@JetBlue we are delayed, until he arrives
@JetBlue flight 894, first officer not even at the airport wow!!!!!! Unreal, staff waited until we all boarded to announce we are delayed.
@JetBlue - why does my TSA-pre work with every airline BUT you? I pay good money for that. Spent 30 mins on phone to fix to zero success.
@JetBlue yes, 3 times. I need some one to call me and help me change a flight. I can't do online. Thanks.
@JetBlue pls send an IT tech 2 baggage office. Poor guy is trying 2 print my claim &amp; can't. I need 2 get home. Upgrade 2 @HP printers MFPs
@JetBlue dropped 3x in past hour
@JetBlue Ive called you 3 x &amp; waited on hold 10 min each time to be disconnected each time. Enraging! I need to speak to someone! #help
@jetblue any idea where the plane for flight 672 is coming from? I thought flight 305 from JFK but that wouldn't explain delay.
@JetBlue pls find my bag, I need 2 get home! Very frustrating. Hope my bag is somewhere in @NY_NJairports. Leaving the #jfk w/o my luggage.
@JetBlue tried calling multiple times, i just wait and when it finally connects i get hung up on
@JetBlue Hold for 15 min, a couple of rings, then ""mailbox has not been set up yet."" Customer service forwarding to their cell phones? C'mon
@JetBlue 
But if customer service ment anything to you.... you would try. Quoting policy is never effective customer service.
@JetBlue why are we delayed :( flight 1601
@JetBlue continue button generated a trip to ""plan your trip page"
regardless of how far along I was in Flight Booking Problems process
hint: the end of it
@JetBlue I'll give u a chance but I don't think I'll fall for it #backtodelta
@JetBlue @KyleJudah new stroller. The travel credit doesn't help cover the cost of a new stroller. Your crew ruined it and therefore should
@JetBlue @KyleJudah I just spoke to the baggage claim center and they gave me travel credit but will not be responsible for the cost of a
@JetBlue heard about the charge for 1st bag and tighter seats - no need to be a loyal JB customer anymore!
@JetBlue Is there something going on with your alerts? Flight's been delayed several times for my parents and i'm not receiving any alerts.
@JetBlue hard to tell, but was told wifi only worked for one side of the plane.
@JetBlue, I normally ❤️ you, but this Late Flightst flight experience was the worst. 2 hours on runway, no wifi &amp; tv not working properly
@JetBlue @KyleJudah It doesn't matter who you directed me to. It's the principle of the matter. When I gate checked the stroller it was
@JetBlue 117 days maybe.
@JetBlue figured but delay is listed at almost 2 hrs. Thanks for being great! Cheers
@JetBlue glitches on website re: Flight Booking Problems travel &amp; checking in. Nothing between ur site &amp; the airport was communicated, it was a nightmare.
@JetBlue as much i have paid in fees. Plus hotel and food because of your changes i could had flown with a more reliable airline #no2jetblue
@JetBlue and they are telling me I got to get another hotel and food...so spend more money because you guys made me miss my connection
@JetBlue already spent $300 to stay at hotel last night due to you guys rescheduling my flight. Since my Cancelled Flightation I've spent almost $500
@JetBlue they are rude and unhelpful. They suggested I catch a flight tomorrow I was supposed to be home today at 2 am and work is waiting
@JetBlue why is my flight delayed 2.5 hours. This is insane. Every other flight has made it to NYC.
@JetBlue I do not want to deal with your customer service agents with no practical knowledge.Provide me with a direct contact.
@JetBlue Got flight reschedule to flight form PIT to FLL and our flight had mechanical problems so we were delayed an hour Missed my connect
@JetBlue my request has nothing to do with rescheduling. But customer service has such a bad attitude today. #badservice
@JetBlue busy due to storm but customer service should always be on point. More so now than ever #getittogether
@JetBlue oh hell no. I'm not waiting again to get hung up on after speaking to 2 #rudeservice people
@JetBlue Is today's JetBlue Flight 918 (NYC-&gt;BOS) delayed? My app says on time and the website says it's not...
@JetBlue A flight delay due to pilots oversleeping is apparently an uncontrollable irregularity that is not eligible for delay compensation.
@JetBlue sitting on the plane in JFK waiting to take off doors are open catering is stocking up we are delayed but they couldn't be nicer
@JetBlue is REALLY getting on my nerves !!  #nothappy
@USAirways and when will one of these agents be available to speak?
@USAirways just hung up on me again.  Another waste of an hour of my time.  How am I supposed to book a one way award flight?  #badwebsite
@USAirways you're killing me from the inside
@USAirways flight 645 to Phoenix deboards passengers going to Salt Lake City because they can't resolve a simple bathroom issue. #fail
@USAirways always fun to get screwed out of an earlier flight (that isn't full) #crummyservice #whydidntiflysouthwest #goodluckamericanair
@USAirways ok...i know doors close ~10 minutes before takeoff. stop telling me my flight will leave in 20 minutes when we haven't boarded.
@USAirways I finally got through on the phone after a 2 hour wait time.
@USAirways Been stuck for 40+ minutes due to lavatory issues. No beverages. No snacks. No customer service. Flt 645 to PHO... #fail #refund
@USAirways I've been on hold to change a date on a ticket for over 3 hours. Can someone please assist me? Unacceptable.
@USAirways thanks 4 making it impossibly expensive 2 change 2 a flight leaving less than 24 hrs earlier than my reservation #1lesscustomer
@USAirways I cant get anyone on the phone to help with award travel.Purchased extra miles and 10 minutes Late Flightr the miles needed was raised.
@USAirways Why haven't you issued a travel advisory for Charlotte Wednesday night and Thursday? 4-6 inches of snow.
@USAirways thanks for making me miss my meeting in Dallas. 700 dollars down the toilet 
@USAirways ur ""response"" was: my ""inconvenience was of no matter."" U wanted me sit for 3 xtra nights in the city w/out comp! #donotflyusair
@USAirways - been standing at the gate for 45 min trying to go standby bc I will miss my connection. No help! Do NOT fly US AIRWAYS!
@USAirways There is an error w/ my preferred status &amp; I'm not able to reach an agent via phone. Travel Friday. Need resolved - contact info?
@USAirways @AmericanAir how does a pilot forget log book? Been waiting on plane for 45 mins!! #AlsoNoDrinkCartComingAround
@USAirways already did it. One person said they couldn't do anything another said she didn't know why the first person we talked 2 said that
@USAirways @AshleyKAtherton Over an hour on hold so far
@usairways RT @Dmoukdarath: Nice, another delay with @usair second one this trip. Left engine leaking...what's next?? #USAIR #nothappy
@USAirways I want to love you! 43 minutes on hold! Help me understand why I switched loyalty programs. http://t.co/cHGy5yrVka
@USAirways 44 minutes on hold so far. And still haven't spoke to a human. Never using you again.
@USAirways You have no idea how upset and frustrated I am right now. I'll be sure to follow through with never flying with you again.
@USAirways how can a person go from number one on a standby list to number twelve in three hours?  Should I be super platinum diamond status
@USAirways Need to talk to a person about my bag. Waiting on hold for two hours. Bag s!b delivered last night. Online says not found.
@USAirways I don't want your sympathy I want someone to make an effort to find my bag
@USAirways She spoke with someone this AM and was told that breast pumps aren't medical equipment and that she should have ""planned better.""
@USAirways - First impressions are hard to reverse.  A horrible first experience with you.  Will never fly with you again!!!
@USAirways not going as planned is an understatement. My flight was just changed AGAIN. If it weren't for a family emergency, I'd Cancelled Flight.
@USAirways sadly that didn't help me at my meeting at work today seeing as my presentation was in there! Major strike against me!!!
@USAirways my bag is still lost and I can not get anyone on the phone to assist me and the tracking updates have stopped
@USAirways 167 minutes?  ""Im not trained in that"". Cmon. Can't you do better than that?
@USAirways any direct number to dividend miles account info? Every Time I try them I get actually hung up on
@USAirways but I've been trying to call them since yesterday and I keep getting hung up on? Can you get me through to them??
@USAirways 2day: no coffee &amp; 1 working toilet.  Then I read domestic airlines whining re: foreign competition.  Coincidence?  No  #openskies
@USAirways I've been on hold to rebook a Cancelled Flighted flight for over two hours. I know weather has a huge impact, but you should anticipate.
@USAirways Been on hold for over 5 hours! I believe I was overcharged $200 for my flight, I need an immediate explanation. HELP
@USAirways still on hold...1 hr 27 mins....thank god for chairman status. status match @Delta?
@USAirways has the worst customer service. Can't even get through to a rep you gotta be kidding me
@USAirways @Beamske But maybe I can be on hold for 30 minutes again. That would be just as amazing.
@USAirways @Beamske how about a real live person talk to the person whose luggage was lost for 4 days and vacation wrecked . @yorkshire2002
@usairways is your clt departures delayed? Hoping I can make my connection after a lengthy take off delay and endless taxi-ing here at clt
@USAirways So frustrating because I still have not gotten them back. Why my bag was sent to NY is a mystery!  Shame on me this time!
@USAirways I will NEVER travel US Airways again. Flew in from LA to DC last night and for the 2nd time on this airline my bags didn't arrive
@USAirways like they will call me? I'v been trying since yesterday and no one is answering...
@USAirways your CSR in PHL suck.   Flt 3883 gets cx'd,  i get rebooked to the next day?  On standby for 4011. Not hopeful.
@USAirways HELLO!! Is anyone behind your twitter account? #badcustomerservice
@USAirways I keep getting hung up on. PLEASE respond so I can book a ticket with you. I won't be able to buy one unless I speak to someone!
@USAirways hey!!  Yeah last time I got a phone call when flight was Cancelled Flightled from DCA to BOS
@USAirways When you are deciding to wreck a vacation... is losing luggage from a Cancelled Flighted flight your ""go to"" maneuver?
@USAirways Been on hold for 40 minutes, calling because my flight is delayed.  This type of service in not acceptable.
@USAirways been on hold for 2 hours for something which I could have done in less than 1 minute if it was available.Your site UX is awe full
@USAirways i understand that but i should still be able to view my reservation online....
@USAirways - Good to know that your phone customer service is still impaired due to ""bad weather"" that was over a week ago #jetblueanyone?
@USAirways OK we are on DAY 11 trying to  book a flight for 4.  Ur system STILL says ""due to weather….call back Late Flightr""  #outofbusiness ?
@USAirways Thanks again for ruiningmy vacation.  You all are the best for this.  Could not have done it without you.
@USAirways @AmericanAir our honeymoon was delayed a day because a gas cap was not screwed on! Flight 1801- so frustrating!
@USAirways Your policy needs a serious revision for babies.  Fortunately I have choices and choose @Southwest from here on out.
@USAirways still ignoring my question. #USAirways consistently providing poor customer service.
@USAirways they have all of this at hotels. Still don't have my work folder or business casual clothes. #worst http://t.co/JIEYCat1Ek
@USAirways oh I got right through to an agent. They just kept putting me on hold and still didn't fix the problem
@USAirways There is no reFlight Booking Problems the event I'm flying to attend. Waiting for jetway driver??? STILL ON TARMAC???
@USAirways Baggage Team? Recording tells me my bag still hasn't been found. And delayed baggage link on web conveniently not working. #worst
@USAirways been trying for weeks no use
@USAirways should give me free baggage for this mess
@USAirways I really feel like your company needs evaluate their policies &amp; realize that transfers should be possible for tickets
@USAirways seriously???  did you not see that I've spent 2 days - for multiple hours on hold just to have to hang up after the hours?
@USAirways. R U aware your wait time to talk to a sales agent is always 30-60 minutes? Unacceptable. At least employ a call back feature!
@USAirways can you DM please in regards to update on lost bag please.
@USAirways need to retrain US 3837 lead flight attendant and gate agent at arrival MKE 2/23.  Horrible attitudes toward helping customers.
@USAirways Youre batting .1000. Every flight Ive taken is delayed. Worst airline. ever.
@USAirways They're also saying the CLT flights are delayed but you're not showing it in your system which makes it impossible to figure out
@USAirways nope, they just announced we're headed back to the gate.
@USAirways pretty sure we didn't actually take off at 7:10 http://t.co/vuxf4r4Unu
@USAirways well then that is a horrible flaw in your system. 2 hours in the past day I've wasted. I've got a job &amp; family this is crazy
@USAirways just wasted another hour of my life on hold. this is insanity. there has to be another way to use my voucher as payment online
@USAirways @united two broken airplanes, two days Late Flightr and I'm stranded after a funeral and missing out on my last semester of #college. 
@USAirways @AmericanAir Day 3 &amp; still no luggage Chkd http://t.co/MbLTALr4BS STATUS=AWAITING ASGMNT TO DRIVER Since yest 10:15am
@USAirways Flight 830 CLT to Phl. I was 1st on list.Someone else got spot. Rude employee in coach. Wouldt give ID. Said he was cute red head
@USAirways asked her why needed to take yellow tag off. She said, ""because I told you to!"" Expect a personal apology from her- unacceptable!
@USAirways , since jan 22 have been on 10 flights. Why the disrespect in CLT, flt #2063 at 2:50pm on 18feb to DCA? just asked herba question
@USAirways I've been on hold for 41min. Just trying to change my reservation.
@USAirways I just spent 3.5 hours and got nowhere. Entire experience #epicfail
@USAirways Changing my flights with no explanations and still don't have a confirmation. So disappointed in the service
@usairways I will make sure to never use your incompetent airlines again. My luggage has been out for delivery for 24 hours.
@usairways My flight was Cancelled Flighted Saturday. Why was my luggage not at the airport? Today, I'm supposed to have it delivered. Pathetic
@usairways  Thank you for allowing me to spend more money on vacation by buying things I already bought.
@USAirways some flexibility on your part would be nice. This is why I love @SouthwestAir. They're flexible &amp; not trying to take all my $.
@USAirways it doesn't take 6 days to respond to an already open case!
@USAirways are people going to answer our calls?
@USAirways pilot forgets to show up to work and Ricky J (gate agent) gives customers attitude. #usairwaysfail
@USAirways : You Make the Reservation; We'll Make the Excuses! #usairwaysfail
@USAirways is utterly unreliable! They didn't schedule a pilot for their US624 flight out of Seattle - flights are delayed #usairwaysfail
@USAirways yes but again valuable time has been lost
@USAirways I don't like being lied to. No bad weather in dc md va. I've been stuck in CA all day and should've been home by now. You owe me.
@USAirways yes it landed at 11:40am. Should not take another 12+ hours to go 40 min drive. Was assured I would have this am.
@USAirways the disappointment was not the bag but that it arrived before me and I was kept 12 hrs without options in IAH
@USAirways can't get back lost time
@USAirways flt 1820 2rsw could have extended the courtsey of waiting 2min 4 10 of us.... gates closed in r faces.  Ur fired
@USAirways - thanks however I feel like the system has failed me -- what is the solution?
@USAirways my bag landed 1 day Late Flight at sfo at 11:40am. How can it be 10:01pm and I still don't have it? Flight 719 2/22/14
@USAirways thanks for nothing. Bought two tix through you to Disney and my friend can't go and now I have to eat the 400, plus 600 for new 1
@USAirways Hi. I'm in LGA but my luggage is in CLT. Have been told to come back tomorrow to collect. Do you guys want to cover my taxi fare?
@USAirways  Instead of fair treatment, I got a nasty letter from a lady in senior management that illness forfeits miles like death.
@USAirways  A few years ago I lost over 50,000 miles bc I was physically unable to fly during the period.  I submitted a doctor's note.
@USAirways  I've never been treated this badly
@USAirways  I'm glad this airline is going to be swallowed by American!!! American always picks up the phone and solves problems.
@USAirways  Three months and my miles haven't been credited.  No one is going to read the email I sent.
@USAirways   My email gets me a canned response that it takes 10 days for mileage to get credited --- It's been three months and my miles
@USAirways   No one picks up the phone all day/  no opportunity to leave a voicemail
@USAirways  Instead, the miles are credited to an account that i did not open
-- My request to merge the accounts is denied
@USAirways No I was there 12 hrs early! Send me an email to share my experience You don't want this blasting here.
@USAirways  I open the credit card and earn 44,000+ miles, and you wont' credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles
@USAirways  you took the miles out of my account and told me that I could restore by paying $150 or opening a credit card
@usairways - It's all automated and no one cares to understand the problem I'm having
@USAirways screwed me up big. 1st flight 1hr Late Flight. Made it to 2nd flight. CSM daryl wouldn't let me on the plane because we were (1/4)
@USAirways Houston hub Aa T. Employee the bag is not here, It made it to Pa before me! Oops not your problem http://t.co/Uld0hWFkfo
@USAirways charged my card 11 times for one airline ticket, now card is on security hold
@USAirways I've flown US Airways at least five times. Every single time has been like this. Actions speak louder than words.
@USAirways membership has no privileges anymore - my son is in the army, short window to see him - NO help.
@USAirways honestly - how is it quickly as possible I've been on hold sine 9:50pm? Everyone that answers has to send me to someone else.
@USAirways really???  NOT ONE OF THEM CAN BOOK DIVIDEND MILES TRAVEL - Literally on hold now since 9:50pm - it's 11:30pm #NoExcuses
@USAirways yeah I know that but that doesn't get me my money back does it, everytime I fly with you something bad happens.
@USAirways is the worst. I have to pay $200 just to NOT take my first flight in a round trip! Otherwise they'll Cancelled Flight my whole flight.
@USAirways if it was so important, why did I wait on hold and then get hung up on by your computer?  #disappointed
@USAirways terrible service
@USAirways Disgusted with your poor customer service. U wrongfully remove &gt; 65,000 miles from my Dividend Miles and no live person,
@USAirways Please hold flight US 639 in Phoenix! I'm a weary traveler stuck on another flight because the tarmac is having issues!
@USAirways - No live person to speak with all day at Dividend Miles, after they wrongfully took over 65,000 miles out of my account.
@USAirways my frustrations are the result of multiple experiences Late Flightly. Currently lost luggage. I want to talk to a real person.
@USAirways cust svc means nothing! So disappointed. Trying since 730a to speak to a human I get bad weather not bad service.
#socialtantrum
@USAirways yes, but I had to pay more for another flight to get me out tomorrow since there weren't anymore for tonight...not fun :-/
@USAirways it is my fault but i bought online and i get twice why i buy twice it fault but i bougth ticket jfk to mccaren and usairways ++
@USAirways was transf, held 15-18 min more b4 agent answered and helped. By time I got to person fare I'd seen was gone.  Had to get supv.
@USAirways you are the actual worst.  You have zero respect for your passengers. I'm officially done flying with you.
@USAirways has the worst customer service line.  I've called them 8 times today and not once was I able to talk to a real human being.
@usairways that wasn't the issue. Someone finally helped on the phone. Now theres a website error that won't let me process my request. SMH
@USAirways you say to call travel agency and they say we cant refund because usairways didnt accept this.
@USAirways ... I f@$%ing hate you.
@USAirways travel agency said that if usairways accept we will refund money i dont understand why dont u refund
@USAirways finally spoke with someone. I have to email the refund dept. I love you guys, but 6 hours in line to be told no dice sucks.
@USAirways well I thought they had hours ago but just found out that no I do not have a seat
@USAirways : Was on flight 2046 BOS-CLT on 2/22, awful experience, exit row seat was so narrow that I could not move my legs! Unacceptable.
@USAirways yes, but we were answered and put back on hold while they were to check on our request..  50 mins Late Flightr nothing!
@USAirways   Not good. On hold for over an hour. http://t.co/wSgYckCIIO
@USAirways I've been on hold for over an hour.  Not doing so well in the customer service department.  #weak
@USAirways - 53 minutes on hold for a reservation?
@USAirways #DividendRewards Urgently need to speak with a CS rep. My 50K miles havent shown &amp; I've fulfilled all reqs. Flight Booking Problems flights today
@usairways I've been on hold for over an hour only b/c my CC miles aren't showing up. What a mediocre combo of cc &amp; airline #SwitchingBoth
@USAirways I am a premium #DividendMiles #cardholder. Unacceptable 4 you to #hangup my #customerservice call twice after putting me on hold.
@USAirways I bougth ticket same fligths twice and you dont refund money it is big problem other company refund money why dont u pay back
@USAirways @AmericanAir now this is beyond ridiculous. Some steering problem delays us again. #neveragain  it's no wonder you had to sell
@USAirways hi, Im trying to speak with someone to book travel for a minor. The phone keeps disconnecting. Please advise. Website wont allow.
@USAirways did a pre schooler develop your app? The thing crashes every single time.
@USAirways and @FlyKnoxville - bad weather should not be an excuse for not following established luggage procedures. #NoClothesNoInfo
@USAirways #FAILINGYOURCUSTOMER ONE BY ONE
@USAirways @PhilaCarService looks like a long trip from cancun to philly? 9 hours Late Flight? Seriously?
@USAirways. Yet another delay/missed connection....and your customer service has an attitude with me? Wow.
@USAirways 1,223.22 of unusable funds. Will not book with you again. #usairwaysfailscustomers
@USAirways #NoService good luck trying to reach a human!  Twice sat on hold for over 50 mins...  #neveragain
@USAirways every single time i fly you guys i am delayed at least 30 minutes. Every time. On flight 5612 out of #CLT to nola.
@USAirways is it ok for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? I was shocked listening
@USAirways changed our flight 6 times in 1 trip. Bumped to @Delta now &amp; having great experience. Never. Flying. US Air again. Never.
@USAirways I can't wait to never fly with you again. Always delayed. Always lose my bag. Rudest people on the planet. Southwest is the best
@USAirways sat on the ramp for 45 min and missed my connection. No one seems to concerned at usairways.
@USAirways It's very difficult to work with Baggage claims when they don't answer the phone
@USAirways I lost an ID on your plane and having trouble finding a contact for your lost and found in Cleveland Hopkins Airport. Please Help
@USAirways I have better Intel than she does!  She said plane is due in at 630.  Flightaware and your own app say 645
@USAirways not likely, flightaware says plane is still in Durango and hasn't departed.
Too little, too Late Flight. You suck RT @USAirways: @mitchsunderland Oh no, Mitchell. Our agents are happy to offer you available options.
@USAirways should, but didn’t.
@USAirways i have been patient.. especially the first time. i will never fly with you again
@USAirways seriously? Every flight I have had the past 2 days has been delayed. Every single one. Terrible
@USAirways I just want to be heard and to discuss the many issues on my trip
@USAirways what's up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at PHX B18?  Nice customer service.
@USAirways I’m still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn’t up on current policy to argue with a traveler.
@USAirways yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping.....  what about the impossible connection that started this?
@USAirways I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding &amp; we all sat in the plane for almost 2 hrs
@USAirways and despite tailwind… Will still be Late Flight.
@USAirways 1500 characters are not enough to convey the issue. Was directed to emailmailto:customer.relations@usairways.com unmonitored. BAD
@USAirways i have and you have not been able to locate them, its insane. i trust you and PAY you to look after my things and you lost them.
@USAirways and yet the Flight Attendant argued with me over Exec Plat benefits...
@USAirways please stop asking me each week to place my bag in the size check #ITFITS http://t.co/AUrn07pWD4
@USAirways Yes, ground crew finally showed up so plane could depart very Late Flight.
@USAirways is anything being done to make Flight Attendants aware of AA member benefits? Embarrassing being argued with. Just happened.
@USAirways @Gregm528 well there is certainly nothing happening ""in front"" of the scenes. #Noaccountability  #disappointing
@USAirways 4 hours on tarmac in Charleston and still can't get a response after a week. Unacceptable
@USAirways  I will never fly us airways again.
@USAirways so I get bumped to the 6pm to Birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled don't have enough hours together. Fail
@USAirways horrible travel day w/ your airlines. My 2:20 flight to Birmingham was Cancelled Flightled w/ no notification so I couldn't get on the 4:05
@USAirways 24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination.
@USAirways it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink/snack detailed here: https://t.co/9zA6xb1h89 &amp; being argued with.
@USAirways I am so disappointed with the service I received with you on my travels to NC these past few days .. you lost my baggage twice.
.@USAirways Have you just given up?
.@USAirways and then you said I could move my Thursday flight for free if I CALL A NUMBER. And then you HANG UP ON ME.
@USAirways Are you not even going to acknowledge that you bumped me from a flight (NOT BECAUSE OF WEATHER I AM IN ARIZONA)
@USAirways Your ""moveup"" policy really sucks. United has a 24 hour policy for this with status. I was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am...
@USAirways why is it impossible to change / buy preferred seats via your app?
@USAirways why are your customer service department so intent on ignoring my emails and queries? #badservice #usairways
@USAirways your airway is a joke. I have never dealt with worse service
@USAirways great. I just called your fucking phone number and she hung up on me
@USAirways @hhagerty that's a lie.
@USAirways your customer service # has a recording that says we are to busy to assist and hangs up. Great touch. #poorservice @GMA @CBSNews
@USAirways your lack of customer service has shined. I need you to step up and get my lost baggage to delta. So they can return it to me.
@USAirways do you operate ANY flights without maintenance issues? Flights in/out of DCA Cancelled Flighted, this is getting old. Update fleet pls!
@USAirways And you took away my 1st class seat.  Love being a Chairman Preferred and assigned row 24 seat B middle seat
@USAirways patience is what my connecting flight will need. Why do you guys do this to me every time I travel? Every. Single. Time.
@USAirways PLANS CHANGED! IS THAT WHAT U CALL NOT BEIN ABLE 2 PARK ON TIME PLANES W A 2 HR LAYOVER N B ABLE 2 MAKE UR CONNECTION! #seriously
@USAirways I have a receipt but no conf # for a Thur flight. When I call for help I was literally hung up on b/c of wait times. Help!
@USAirways would help if you flew bigger planes into TLH. All my team mates made it to the training but me.
@USAirways no I am trying to get on a plane from Phx to RNO and the gate is saying the flight was downgraded.
@USAirways She was put on hold on that number for a loooooong time too.  No help. #lostandforgotten
@USAirways I have never had a more unpleasant travel experience in my life. Now I might not get on my flight till tomorrow? This is insane
@USAirways ticket counter people here are not helping and just want to charge more money even after this horrible day.
@USAirways - HA! flight to CTL delayed! Going to miss connection. Can you please transfer me to another airline asap? http://t.co/1XdLbiBClP
@USAirways on 5:55 flight to CTL to catch 8pm flight to sfo. But empty seats on 4:15 flight which wasn't offered.  Awful service continues.
@USAirways I have to fly back to Charlotte out of a different airport. You guys are not very flexible like other airlines.
@USAirways I checked in ""Standby for 1st Class"" only to find I am ""not on the list"". This merger is a pain.
@USAirways been on hold for 45 minutes. Is there a better time to call? This is getting ridiculous
@USAirways Your exchange/credit policies are worthless and shadier than the White House. Dissatisfied to the nines right now.
@USAirways honest question - how is a 1-way ticket from Charlotte (your hub) to LAX (2nd biggest city in USA) almost $600?????
@USAirways only happened because u couldn't get us home the next day. #flydelta #flysouthwest #flyjetblue #theyareallbetter #stillnobags
@USAirways I will never fly @USAirways again
@USAirways OFFERING to give up my bag which you usually have to force passengers to do. I am in a state of shock.
@USAirways power trip. I felt completely threatened and unsafe and I am so angry. Derrick Bussey.  DCA. Would like to reiterate that I was
@USAirways thank you for putting me on a flight that will be leaving Late Flightr than the original flight I was booked on.
@USAirways even if I was the single most unreasonable human being on planet earth, there is no excuse for his treatment of me.
@USAirways you are supposed to be in the business of belong customers; not humiliating them
@USAirways this is no way to treat women.  I want someone to contact me and explain how they will make this acceptable.
@USAirways citizen. I fly your airline constantly and am so offended.  Derrick Bussey. Now Im crying on this airplane because I'm so upset
@USAirways we had a friend there telling the gate attendant and the stewardess what was going on #notourfaultyoudontuseyourgatesright
@USAirways the jetway because he felt I was disrespectful. I have never been treated this way particularly when I was trying to be a good c
@USAirways with such disrespect I cannot even begin to explain. He has an issue with women and he literally yelled at me and pulled me off
@USAirways what happens if it isn't located
@USAirways I want to speak with someone immediately. I am shaking with rage. I offered to hate check my bag and Derrick bussey treated me
@USAirways is okay for u 2 Cancelled Flight change a flight when good 4 u but you cant logistically figure out what 2 do when a plane comes in on time
@USAirways Thanks but when I asked for a change with no cost for you the only desition was nade by computer. Now is Late Flight
@USAirways if you actually cared about what you did it would be one thing. Sounds like you don't like being told how lousy your service is.
@USAirways you idiots kept an on time plane on the Tarmac for over an hour forcing us to not be there 10 minutes before.
@USAirways cust svc just let it slip that previous cust svc lied to me about supervisors &amp; corporate ph#. $200 to change a $130 tix? No thx.
@USAirways please fix your reservations phone system.  The weather/backup could not possibly be bad for 10 days!  #goodgriefpeople
@USAirways 1-2! Rock hit the plane! In a delay now! Never an easy day with US Airways! Ya never fail to let me down!
@USAirways just an FYI I'll be writing registered letters 2 your ceo and those down the line 4 the shameful treatment and reactions we got.
@USAirways you guys Cancelled Flightled two of my flights yesterday and I checked the bag to Huntsville and it went missing in Philly.
@USAirways customer service failure aside, one would think you guys would care about inaccurate manifests. I'm sure TSA would.
@USAirways I find it funny that @PHLAirport responds but you don't. Your customer service is the worst. #wedontcarebecauseyoupaidalready
@USAirways I need to speak with a customer service agent today between 5-8pm  I had an unfortunate incident of discrimination today.
@USAirways @CLTDouglas slowest baggage claim ever
@USAirways Don't blame it on weather. Rep at counter cost me entire day - not weather.  Printed Boarding Pass too Late Flight. #TakeResponsibility
@USAirways too Late Flight.
@USAirways delays due to refueling are out of your control? If that's true I never want to fly US Airways again
@USAirways how about now getting us the rest of our bags please? We only received 2 of 5. Can you help with that?
@usairways im trying to get my dads wheelchair and no one is answering at Dulles.we have tried to call back on.multiple times
@USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Arrive 7 hrs Late Flight; checked car seat missing. No replacement available. Has yet to arrive more than 24 hours Late Flightr.
@USAirways you guys lost my luggage
@USAirways thanks but the bags are only 10% of what went wrong. 22 hours from DCA to SAN when there were no weather issues is not acceptable
@USAirways How can I speak to a human? Need 2 find bag delayed 2/21. Website and 800 # are telling me 2 different things! Got hung up on 2x
@USAirways US 728. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles. Applaud you looking out for the environment.
@USAirways US 728. Nope, not getting off. 3 hours in the plane. 4 pilot announcements. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles.
@USAirways US 728 Uh oh, no gate. Now truck will come to us.
@USAirways I spent an hour on the phone with them and got no where at all
@USAirways US 728 then lost ground power three different times. Not only grounded endlessly; now without air, lights, entertainment.
@USAirways US 728 pilot started the flight by announcing arrival into Gatwick, not Heathrow. Moments of concern for all aboard.
@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. More strange. Now we're not hearing from pilot for long periods.
@USAirways Seat 8D on Flight 545 last night is the worst seat I've ever been in.  No leg room! #dividendsmember http://t.co/NUhpLNXRIq
@USAirways One of your workers was very rude with us. We can tell you in DM cuz it won't be any good publicity...
@USAirways my flight is delayed so I missed my connecting flight. Stuck in Philadelphia over night and no hotel voucher? Thanks for nothing
@USAirways can I speak to a human with some compassion? I wrote an email to discuss my experience and received a generic ""sorry"" email back
@USAirways take a look at 1715. All F seats filled, so someone upgraded their friend instead of following rules.
@USAirways back in line at terminal because phone guy couldn't help.  One person in front of me 20 min wait again? http://t.co/HQHdAD7fvK
@USAirways So you understand why I'm resorting to Twitter: No help available at  gate while this occurred or by phone afterward.
@USAirways going to miss my connection due to another tarmac delay - on US5268 then 4050 - need a flight home today please!
@USAirways, I'm expecting 400% reimbursement for the unprofessional decisions with US728 on 21 Feb. Check your very full complaint box.
@USAirways stranding a student trying to get to Birmingham in CLT overnight w/o any help.  You can do better than that.  @av_duffy
@USAirways well that is not going to help. I'vebeen on hold over 3 hrs &amp; my client wants his ff nbr in the record he's elite wAA
@usairways hi. You lost my father's wheelchair. Every time we call we just get voicemail. My dad needs it to go home. Please DM me.
@USAirways 4 segments, 4/4 delayed. Gnv &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; JAN . JAN &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; GNV. My year off from flying with you guys was the way to go.
@USAirways is charging me $200 to NOT take my flight. Lol. That is the last time I fly with them.
@USAirways yes. It says bag is being delivered. The local number says Not Open. Asked main # for cust service got hung up on.
@USAirways seriously buy some WD40 for A319 operating flight 634 from GEG to Phoenix. Every seat squeaks w every shift. Still on ground!
@USAirways why let passengers on board when there was an issue? Over an hour &amp; the pilot doesn't know when we'll leave.
@USAirways anyone there to help? Still on hold...
@USAirways oh yay! Now gate agents decide not to deal with upgrade list and just bump up whoever is closest.
@USAirways flights &amp; ""customer relations"" are extremely disappointing. Faced too many problems to type. apology=$25 towards a flight. A JOKE
@USAirways sitting here in PHL with all of your rude Customer Service Agents!
@USAirways @AmericanAir - Can flight #415 get the paperwork inputted?? We should have taken off an hour .. #sittingontheplane #hungry
@USAirways now on hold with customer care.  Wonder if someone will pick up the phone before 5pm.
@USAirways when will FLT 445 get a gate at DEN? Over 20 minutes waiting with no information.
@USAirways your delayed flight out of Wilmington made me miss my flight out of Charlotte. Figure out how to take off and arrive on time.
@USAirways usually ""sorry"" doesn't involve moving people to middle seats and removing them from upgrade lists. Guess that's a club perk.
@USAirways horrible service, wrong plane arrived, many confirmed passengers could not get on flight we paid for due to lack of seats flight
@USAirways booked flight 1mnth ago, seat CONFIRMED, small plane arrived and was not allowed to board bcs no seat, horrible service
@USAirways Very frustrated, checked bag in Logan, was not given a luggage ticket,now luggage is lost &amp; no ownership from @USAirways
@USAirways Aye, and nothing to do with an automated system which doesn't work properly. Anyway, got through to somebody...
@USAirways now my rebooked connection is delayed.
@USAirways I am in meetings in California and have no luggage!!
@USAirways And the number your agent gave me to call says you are not open? And the main number goes to a computer saying it is delivered?
@USAirways any way to get your call center to answer for a OneWorld award? Whenever try system says too busy and disconnect or endless hold
@USAirways Why did you put my luggage on the plane after mine? Then not deliver it to me like you said? Now show the claim as closed online?
@USAirways takes my money at once but then requires 7 to 10 days to process a refund? Why does your auto attendant hang up? #usairwaysfail
@USAirways Who intentionally buys a flight with a 10 hour layover?  And what kind of airline would charge $200 to fix it? Wow... #usairways
@USAirways how do I get a hold of customer service? I've called multiple times &amp; have been on hold for 30+ mins only to have to hang up
@USAirways is there a # or a time bracket I can call to fix this problem?I've been attempting to fix this contact information issue for days
@USAirways I called the number and they said no one is available to take my call...guys this is insane
@USAirways / @AmericanAir was the worst experience I've ever had flying. Rude, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, lack of updates, and wasting our time
@USAirways called 3x &amp; it says high call volumes call back. At $1 a minute for international calls is there any way someone can contact me?
@USAirways @jhughes1025 grrrrrrrr. Couldn't book a flight via calling either :(
@USAirways delayed, connection missed, now extended layover how about a lounge pass for PHL. #5077
@USAirways Another twist in the plot. Took off from Miami, then had to return due to a unsecured cargo door. most stressful vacation ever.
@USAirways When I check online it states status closed. What does this mean? As I have yet been able to reach a live person...
@USAirways how do you get your aa frequent flyer number to appear in a USAir reservation?? Frustrating
@USAirways @AmericanAir hey since you    f*%#ed my wknd can I have day pass to admirals club or meal coupon or free coke? {blank stare}
@USAirways Another dead end.  They only handle AA L&amp;F.  They gave me the same failed # I already had. 610-362-7498(99) VM full.  #lost
@USAirways  Houston Gate 17 customer Service needs to treat people with respect. There are hardly people waiting! #chillpill #usairwaysfail
@USAirways That is the height of rudeness, and without question the worst customer service I have ever experienced.
@USAirways I NEED TO *SPEAK* TO SOMEBODY ABOUT A RESERVATION. As in talk to a human being. Yet your computer system puts the phone down on
@USAirways : Premier provider of missed connections! #usairwaysfail
@USAirways thanks for a subpar travel experience and it's not even over yet #stepitup
@USAirways is struggling. had me on hold for 25 minutes, kicked me back to the start, then said they couldnt handle the amount of calls
@USAirways no you call me.
@USAirways they told me to call back Late Flightr
@USAirways i will be Cancelled Flighting my us airways credit card and choosing other airlines after my experience this week.
@USAirways I cant make it to airport, roads are to bad in DFW and no one is answering the phones and the website is down?How do I reschedule
@USAirways Pilot pleads to let boarding begin for full flight #1937 while waiting for 4th flight attendant. Denied by mission control. Grrrr
@USAirways website isnt working and I cant talk to any1 on the phone to check flight status out of dfw. Roads are awful and cant get there
@USAirways rebooked for Tuesday. Arriving too Late Flight for on Tuesday to start the class. Cancelled Flightled the trip.
@USAirways If my flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled every week I might as well be in business class.
@USAirways 2102 DCA-BOS. Cancelled Flightled after making us wait over an hour. If I fly USAir every week can you upgrade my status proactively?
@USAirways congrats on treating your customers the worst way possible. I know plenty of other ppl who have had horrible experience w you too
@USAirways Going to Manchester, UK now i'm going to miss a wedding. You going to rebook that too? Why have you chosen to Cancelled Flight my flight??
@USAirways if you DM me we can take this offline. Would love more info on location of lost bags. Any help is appreciated.
@USAirways thanx but this isn't my first rodeo. Done &amp; done yesterday. No results or comm, unless u count status: bags lost &amp; claim filed.
@USAirways @acnewsguy can you give me a # for US Air in philly to talk to a real person? Acarl4@hotmail.com
@USAirways would have been nice to be offered in flight credit. Especially since I'm staring at empty overhead room.
@USAirways or how about power outlets at your seat if you're gonna keep us siting here forever?
@USAirways I would appreciate a call regarding a HORRIBLE experience I had with a gate agent. Was on hold for 39 min and then hung on me.
@USAirways What is going on with flight 1826 from PHL to PHX? 10 mins to estimated departure nobody has board and no update.
@USAirways but my bag is still missing
@USAirways Customer service is dead. Last wk, flts delayed/Cancelled Flighted. Bags lost 4 days. Last nt, flt delayed/Cancelled Flighted.  No meal voucher?
@USAirways flight US1562 from RIC2DFW was Cancelled Flightled yesterday &amp; I was on hold w/ cust. service from 6-10pm EST...4 hours, no answer...

@USAirways thanks for Cancelled Flighting flight 5097 today. Now missing required training. Not a happy customer.
@USAirways Strike Three!!! You guys suck!!!
@USAirways 2 days in a row, not buying it. I suggest you review your policy w respect to unaccompanied minors, should have had a seat on Sun
@USAirways Wife and I flew to Italy recently. Bought tickets via Finnair, flights operated by USAir. Didn't get dividend miles credited.
@USAirways 8 hour delay pho-mia, your airline is bad and getting worse, Foolish for american to merge.  You treat your customers like crap
@USAirways @AmericanAir 28 hours Late Flightr still no email. work supervisor needs documentation to approve last minute vacation day request
@USAirways here's to sitting on hold for 4 hrs flight Cancelled Flighted and they disconnect twice. #fend4urself #stranded #diverted
@USAirways Cancelled Flights flight Tampa to Philadelphia today due to runway conditions yet tonnes of USAirways flights landing there today, explain!
@USAirways no my flight plans have been delayed until tuesday due to your computer crash
@USAirways 4914 from PHL to BGM. I cannot believe this has happened 2x in under two weeks!
@USAirways @AmericanAir at 9:05am after the plane left: ""why were there no agents and why were the doors closed so early?""
@USAirways I called more than 25 times to redeem mile points and can't get through.  You advertise the miles but make them very hard to use!
@USAirways @AmericanAir me after arriving at 8:41am for a flight scheduled to depart at 8:57am. doors closed, no agents
@USAirways I need to speak with a live person. I've had it with the recordings. I was told on Sat that we'd have our luggage by yest.
@USAirways thx for delayed checkin on noon flt to mia then forcing me to take Late Flightr flts which were delayed. Cincy to Miami in 13 hrs! #fast
@USAirways getting extremely frustrated w/ the phone/online service for merging frequent flyer miles.
@USAirways already spent 60 mins today handling this for my minor child. Shame on you for treating a 15 year old girl like this.
@USAirways First the pilot was Late Flight, now it's maintenance. This is EXACTLY what happened two weeks ago. Unacceptable.
@USAirways I will NEVER fly us airways or american again and I will share this nightmare of a story to all the many others we know who fly
@USAirways i have never been treated so poorly by an airline in my life, as a military family we do alot of flying..
@USAirways @AmericanAir - Burned a lot of time and cell minutes working through this flight issue - hopefully we fly home in the morning.
@USAirways you would rather a while plane get exposed to a nasty contagious virus then work wth me to get my flight changed to a Late Flightr date
@USAirways i worked with you and bought my own rental car when you failed to get me to the location i paid to get to and now....
@USAirways I've been on hold for 30 minutes and counting. #unacceptable
@USAirways Discovered our flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday at 3:30PM - @americanairlnes finally notified us our flight was Cancelled Flighted at 0316 AM
@USAirways I am appalled. My departure with you was all messed up and now on return i am supposed to fly alone with two very sick kids
@USAirways Will tweet all day until I get 
a live cust rep. I will make sure the world knows you don't care about your customers health.
@USAirways Decided to be a good sport and give you guys another shot. Flight delayed. Again.
@USAirways @AmericanAir on hold for 8 hours yesterday w/o speaking to an agent on hold again w/ 2 phones ~30 mins let the bashing begin...
@USAirways please fix the very unproductive check in process at @DCA. 20 check in stations and 2 people working them. What a total mess!!!!
@USAirways you denied a mom her AM flight because she NEEDED her breast pumping parts on a full flight? Please FIX this ASAP!! #freeflight
@USAirways: I relied on US Airways, and that was my mistake. Awful customer experience.
@USAirways Thank you. The website crashing for me.
@USAirways. On hold 2hrs after my flight was Cancelled Flightled &amp; ""Anthony"" was beyond rude and not helpful! @AmericanAir they're weighing you down.
@USAirways Will the nightmare ever end? Just found out our flight today is delayed due to ""ground handling delays affecting a prior flight.""
@USAirways first, luggage got stuck in a different city, now I get them back today &amp; one of your employees stole a pair of gloves from me!
@USAirways sure knows how to pamper customers they strand abroad. #badcustomerservice #fend4yourself #youareonyourown http://t.co/Pw1eudlcZg
@USAirways We take Late Flight to a whole new level!
@USAirways You guys are screwing up my trip. Thanks for nothing. #lazy
@usairways Seriously. This is ridiculous. I shouldn't have to wait a hour for my luggage after I land. #wtf
@usairways Why are we waiting 40 min so far for our luggage??? #wannagohome
@USAirways the only time I tweet is to tell you how horrible you're attendants are. Flight 3841 to LGA. I feel in jail
@USAirways forced sections 4 and 5 to check their carry on. would have packed differently to check my bag. Why even allow it? #pissed
@USAirways flt 419. 2+ hrs Late Flight, baggage + 1 more hr. Now I see they delivered my suitcase wet inside &amp; out. #NotHappy
@USAirways then she had to get her own hotel so ur agents did nothing to help and to top it off you sent her luggage on the wrong flight!!!
@USAirways so she has to take a Late Flightr flight booked by her corporate (Disney) travel dept, as your agent offered little help
@USAirways your computer system went down ok that is understandable but the agents make it worse by not helping her or anyone else
@USAirways as the employee responsible for social media content, yes u probably do care however the actions from last night say otherwise
@USAirways Flight gets in 30 minutes early and all goodwill gone when bags aren't here 45 minutes Late Flightr
@USAirways. wow, awful customer service.
@USAirways merging with American will negatively affect your quality and integrity. I will no longer fly with you because of it.
@USAirways flight 435 is delayed so will miss connecting flight 457 can you please help with alternate? Thank you.
@USAirways three hour wait and counting waiting for reservations on the phone. Are you serious!?
@USAirways What a mess caused by the computer systems. Flight 719 in 3 hours Late Flight and now no gate for us. Est 26 min wait.
@USAirways Storm or no storm, your customer service is a joke. 6 hour wait time to speak to someone? I will never fly your airline again.
@USAirways you guys have my luggage in San Jose and were supposed to deliver it to my hotel hours ago!! Please contact me.
@USAirways I've flown 6 figured worth of miles in my lifetime.  This was my first and last ever flight on US Airways
@USAirways pls get me back to Tallahassee:( no one should ever have to be stranded in Gainesville for this long
@USAirways your a miserable airline and your loss of revenue is a reflection of that.  Go extinct.  A merger only delays the inevitable
@USAirways What was the point of the merger?  Why not just go out of business if your not turning a profit anymore?
@USAirways Finally got ahold of an Agent after another hour. Thanks for the follow up.  Recommend a call back feature.
@USAirways IS THIS RINGLING BROTHERS BARNUM AND BAILEY???  SHOULD I KEEP MY EYES PEELED FOR THE CLOWN CAR???
@USAirways not to mention the fact that my flight was delayed BECAUSE YOUR COMPUTERS WERE DOWN
@USAirways how do I get off my plane and wait over an hour and a half to speak to someone about reFlight Booking Problems?
@USAirways Please don't trivialize me.  This is a joke, not a slow day or slow experience
@USAirways And how do you only have 1 agent at PHX customer service desk when an hour ago the line was over 100 people long?
@USAirways sorry doesn't help.  It's midnight PST.  How in the hell am I still on hold after 90 minutes on customer service line?
@USAirways you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly.
@USAirways But nope!  Apparently this is the way you guys do business!  I guess I'm flying southwest and her blue from now on.
@USAirways I keep thinking this is a massive practical joke and someone is gonna appear out of thin air and take me to Reno tonight.
@USAirways there's over 50 people in line and only one agent!
@USAirways And by the way, I'm planning it while I've Ben waiting in the line at customer service in PHX...for over an hour!
@USAirways I can legitimately say that I would have rather driven cross country than flown on US Airways.
@USAirways and despite the fact I see you answering all these people on twitter with mundane qs you refuse to answer me!
@USAirways you guys are the worst airline I've ever dealt with.  No notifications, no keeping customers updated.  Terrible service
@USAirways hey guys!  Thanks for answering me and thanks for keeping me on hold for an hour on customer service at 12 pm PST!
@USAirways is the worst airline to ever travel with.
@USAirways has to be the most lazy, inconsiderate, and unprofessional airline that I have ever traveled.
@USAirways Do you have any pride in your service? Any concerns for my wife and everyone else on that flight? Or you just don't care????!!!
@USAirways who's in charge of your company? My wife missed her connection to CA you sent her luggage on another flight
@USAirways the call hung up on me..
@USAirways got this message on your site to call about my flight - just gave up after being on hold for 3 HOURS! http://t.co/5cDX2ROAE6
@USAirways #usairways lost a passenger today for not upholding their promise of excellent customer service!!!
@USAirways yet again your staff in Philadelphia  failed to send my luggage home with me. #alwayshappensthere #angrytraveler
@USAirways  ok my 4th try today....giving up at 12.45am after 138 minute hold time. #terrible http://t.co/Ps9Q9RPSiL
@USAirways it still says that I can't check into my flight because the information is incorrect but everything is entered correctly
@USAirways this says it was estimated to leave an hour ago (it hasn't left yet) so thanks for this useful information. #TheWorstAirline
@USAirways your customer service is horrendous. Between the way employees speak customers and their lack of care for problems with flights.
@USAirways had mom sit for 3 hours waiting for a flight they ultimately Cancelled Flighted to give her a Tuesday morning flight...no compensation. Ugh
@USAirways does anyone from your airline know how to do their job?
@USAirways Has To Be THE WORST Airline Of All Time
@USAirways denied me standby bc of checked bag in cvg 5163 to Phl @ 6..so I had to take delayed 3751 4 hrs Late Flightr...except u lost bag in cvg
@USAirways .... I've been trying to get through to book a reservation and the system will not let me through. Day 3 #ridiculous
@USAirways you are the worst.
@USAirways making folks run from gate C29 to A18 to B11 with NO EXPLANATION and zero carts to transfer elderly and handicap. #PHL
@USAirways have been waiting in an airplane for a total of 3 hours to take off between 2 flights today...this usually doesn't happen...
@USAirways not given option for new flight! Why can't we get a plane PHL-MIA? 20years as an #eventprof this is worst travel experience ever
@USAirways doesn't let u do stand by on flight due to checked bag causing u to get in 5 hours Late Flightr only to get to PHL &amp; bag didn't make it
@USAirways absolutely worst experience of my life at PHL. 6 hrs, 1 failed departure, 3 gates, and ZERO communication or help!!
@USAirways @AmericanAir as soon as I call customer service to speak to a representative, I am disconnected
@USAirways @AmericanAir have been trying to call customer service since 9pm. After an hour, was disconnected. Spoke to no one
@USAirways give us no information and an attitude.
@USAirways attendants at the gate. Enjoyed watching the other flight to our destination take off before having a horrible attendant give us
@USAirways now has stranded is in #Miami without updating any of the departure boards, and once they Cancelled Flightled the flight there was no...
@USAirways you are absolutely terrible at managing these delays... Been delayed and undelayed and delayed 6 times now. 10 AM office hours.
@USAirways @AmericanAir have the most rude, unreliable, horrible company with equally rude, unreliable and horrible employees. Stay tuned.
@USAirways #PHL why does it take an hour to offload bags, especially after taking 30+ min to get a jetway to get off plane after landing?
@USAirways flight #703 Philly -&gt; Mia? Bwahahaha! Delayed 5+ hrs, were in the air 30 mins then turned back around. #usairwaysfail
@USAirways I'm tired of paying for luggage &amp; less than stellar customer service @AmericanAir. #notafanofyourmerger
@USAirways we flew out, through and into good weather. when we landed,  another technical issue with gate. improve service or lose customers
@USAirways - is stranding your customers, not reFlight Booking Problems them, and then not answering the phone the way you treat Platinum members?
@USAirways I made a reservation online but I didn't receive any confirmation email. My bank said the transaction went through. Can u help?
@USAirways This is the worst flying experience of my life. Flight scheduled for departure at 5:44pm from Phl. 5+ hrs Late Flightr guess where I am?
@USAirways any update on this flight?It's more than three hours delayed. Thank you.
@USAirways @AmericanAir you should partner w/ a different hotel in PHL, the clarion is proving to be very difficult &amp; not customer friendly
@USAirways truly dissapointed when our flight is delayed and going to miss connection that we are expected to rebook our own flight????????
@USAirways - you kind of screwed my day up, at least it was outbound, but you did save it by stranding me in a @RenHotels @MarriottRewards
@USAirways nightmare trying to get to Costa Rica from PHL today. Stuck in Miami and no one answers at 800 number.
@USAirways @PeterPiatetsky Ummmm I think US Air's computers@were@down for hours - my flight is 3 hours Late Flight.
@USAirways comedy of errors continues..."" We can't get into our gate, there is a broken down truck in the way"" #fail
@USAirways Instructions say to CALL. I'm just doing what it said to do.
@USAirways The fact we did not get notified hindered our ability to look for alternate flights before they were snapped up.
@USAirways you're really fudgin up with all these delays  #justwantmybed
@USAirways Just discovered that they billed us $300 for the rescheduled flight, which cost me a second day of lost work.
@USAirways Today USAir Cancelled Flightled our rescheduled flight &amp; did not notify us except possibly to our home phone-not helpful since we are in CO
@USAirways Thanks for ruining my last night of vacation because I have to worry about my flight because y'all don't have record of it

@USAirways  flight missed due to mech issue. No food voucher, transported to different airport, no rental reimbursement 
@USAirways @PHLAirport we don't control your stupidity in not having room to have a plane come in. You better not mess with us now.
@USAirways  Interesting you forward compliments but never complaints!  World's worst airline #GoingForGreatnessFAIL
@USAirways - flights 4500 AND 403 delayed for ""crew availability?""  What gives? I'm getting to TPA 2.5 hrs past my scheduled arrival.
@USAirways how is it that the airport (DCA) and the airline mess up our flights, but also will not cover our hotel costs? At DCA for 5hrs...

@USAirways why does this flight keep getting delayed Late Flightr and Late Flightr?
@USAirways @AmericanAir so does that mean @AmericanAir that you might care about my sister be assaulted on one of your flights
@USAirways on top of that a dozen ppl missed connections and you have ONE person at customer service? Abysmal!
@USAirways @AmericanAir how is it possible that someone is drunk they bring a wheelchair for them but you keep serving them
@USAirways your service at PHL is abysmal. An hour on the runway waiting for a gate, no information anywhere, missed my connection abysmal!
@USAirways @AmericanAir  worst customer service ever how can you let people be assaulted on your flights and do nothing about it
@USAirways @AmericanAir Not providing pilots for your flights: is this a new feature of your merger? #efficencies
@USAirways so I guess you are ok with people being sexually assaulted on your flights nice customer service
@USAirways @AmericanAir USAIR #703 has returned to PHL due to issues with the fire detectors. What happens next?
@USAirways ur specialist said they would talk to the stewardess about not serving drunks drinks, REALLY how does that help
@USAirways what is wrong in Boston? Why are only your plains not leaving tonight? Son needs to get back to state college, PA
@USAirways over two hours on hold to talk to an agent..then it disconnects me.  been trying for two days! Wtf! Hire some CSRs u make $ now
@USAirways so you don't have a pilot now for #clt ✈ #ord for at least another hour. Why on earth would you board the plane? Makes no sense!
@USAirways flight 2120. Please get us a flight plan already. How is this an issue in 21st century?

@USAirways @PHLAirport this is the reason I avoid @PHLAirport and @USAirways like the plague. Glad to see this merger is working well. #dumb

@USAirways if you are going to make me wait in the phone for a long time can you at least turn off the ads they are eating away at my soul
@USAirways US Airlines 699 LA to RDU is holding onto baggages for an hour already and everyone is still waiting!?
@USAirways we've now learned to never fly with u again. You've lost 16 customers from our group + the hundreds more from our company
@USAirways spoke with your reps in NH and PA. Very poor communications. Bags still sitting in Philly. TRAIN YOUR STAFF
@USAirways thanks for the worst customer service on the face of the earth. I loved the 5+ hrs on hold along w 2 Cancelled Flightled flights
@USAirways I tried reaching out to you guys I'm running out time and patience I just want my flight to be honor and I want a confirmation!
@USAirways and after six hours even the gate agent got fed up and left us all on line in front of an empty desk. Stay classy US Air.
@USAirways how do you lose a pilot????
@USAirways the ads on your phone systems when waiting for a rep is the most annoying thing ever especially when waiting for over 10 mins...
@USAirways @AmericanAir we are missing our connection due to delay out of LAS. What are we supposed to do now?

@USAirways 6 hours, no agent. Should I keep waiting?
@USAirways how hard is it to unload bags in order of arrival? 45 mins and counting for flight 699
@USAirways is it policy to tell customers ""We can't help you?"" I'm sorry but this is unacceptable
@USAirways thank you for correctly interpreting my last tweet as non sarcastic and delaying my flight again. YYZ Terminal 3 dance party?
@USAirways my friends at KPHL were told by your rep ""if it were me I woulda just gone home this am and tried again tomorrow."" 1/2

@USAirways you have got to be kidding me!  No info on 4565 from DCA to BGR and your phone line tells me to call back Late Flightr?
@USAirways Its pretty ridiculous that at PHX sky harbor you have 4 (!) employees working check in on a SUNDAY afternoon. 30 min &amp; counting..

@USAirways , I am embarrassed for us air and their inability to manage during weather delays.handling of # 4435 is an example
@USAirways are the bags off Flight 1898 CLT to JFK? We landed last night just before midnight.

@USAirways if I try and call your reservations line will someone answer the phone now or will I be on hold for an hour again?
@USAirways Your customer service line keeps telling me call back Late Flightr and disconnects. How can I talk to someone about my flight?

@USAirways @AmericanAir my friends are stranded at KPHL and the representatives there won't even give them food vouchers…any help please?
@USAirways how is it possible that you don't have a call back service? An automated message telling us to call back Late Flightr is so unhelpful.
@USAirways @Sb5551 Um, WE knew this storm was coming, ? Is why didn't USeless Air?  Staff accordingly u idiots!
@USAirways you can't control the weather but you can control customer service. Without luggage for 24 hours &amp; still yet to speak to a human.
@USAirways Collectively since Friday I've been on hold with customer service for over 3 hrs. My issue is not resolved... so frustrated!
@USAirways The automated message isn't helpful and it's impossible to speak with a human right now. Desperately need our luggage :(
@USAirways @Expedia 7 Hours for my friend to rebook his trip to Korea after @USAirways Cancelled Flightled a connecting flight to Chicago = IDIOTIC.
@USAirways your customer service is atrocious.

@USAirways what is the expected wait time to speak to someone via 800 number?
@USAirways My family, friends and colleagues will NEVER  fly USAir again. Bad weather happens. The good airlines seem to communicate better.
@USAirways Now going on 26 minutes on hold.

@USAirways Hmmm. Did the flight even really exist or did they just create it last night to get people off their backs? #usairsucks
@USAirways And the lies continue. Just waited another hr to get boarding passes for flight supposedly created today which is now Cancelled Flightled?!

@usairways trick for getting into your hold queue?  I've been calling since Thursday and keep getting the ""call back Late Flightr"" message
@USAirways instead of tweeting your customers apologizing why don't you pick up your phone
@USAirways I really appreciate there not being an easy way to get another flight when mine has been delayed over 2hrs for mechanical reasons
@USAirways My bags were supposed to be delivered to NYC last night (missing since Thurs) but are not here. Can someone call me?

@USAirways - almost 2 hrs 30 mins on hold - any idea how much longer?
@USAirways This was a real life exercise in crisis management which @USAirways failed miserably. Some compensation would go a long way.

@USAirways tell my professors that when I don't show up to class/write my midterm because I'm stuck with no flights home 
@USAirways No US Air ppl anywhere in PHL directed stranded pax. Kudos to the PHL employees getting off work at midnight. Only help we got.
@USAirways Hooray! I've now been on hold for over an hour. I've never loved Southwest more.

@USAirways can you please train your mechanics? Teach them to bring the tools to fix the plane with them and not leave them in the hanger.
@USAirways Charlotte Staff needs prayer....disappointed in response to mishaps ......lotttttttt of pissed off people here!!!!
@USAirways thank you for leaving my 74 y/o grandma stranded because connecting flt could not wait 10 minutes. I will never fly you again
@USAirways HELLO?! It's been FOUR HOURS since plane landed!   Flt 630 phx to JFK.  3 hrs on Tarmac waiting 4 gate. Plus an hour no bags yet
@USAirways can you please have your employee that has been called 5 times by the flight crew finish maintenance on US 734 so we can depart!
@USAirways @nm4agoodlife      5 hours on hold and no answer . Guess the synergy of a merger was really planned out
@USAirways still waiting on your reps to show. Now 40 mins into waiting in below freezing weather waiting for a cab.
@USAirways @_RobPrice  how can he try again it will be 5-6 hours before he gets help.  Contingency plans non existent.
@USAirways delayed depart bc ur flight attendant wasn't there. Then after landing took 3 hrs to get a gate. Now it's another he and NO bags
@USAirways @jtrexsocial 5 hours on hold ... Safe to say no one is working .
@USAirways But every time I call I'm on hold for 45 min and then get disconnected. Any way someone can help?
@USAirways surely there are some other ways to help me - I can't really afford another 4 hours now. Pls follow me so we can DM
@USAirways I was on hold for 2 hours and still no answer. Is this really how you run your business? http://t.co/P8xFhq4kps
@USAirways keeps dropping my call and won't even let me stay on hold because they are ""too busy"" #idontwanttocallback
@USAirways I never made a reward reservation becuase no one ever answered the phone. The online one I made got Cancelled Flighted and I can't change
@UsAirways can a real person help me here? This customer service is poor. I'm at the mercy of someone since the flights are disappearing.
@USAirways Your customer service is  non-existent/ terrible. Dozens waiting for bags not placed on our flight, no staff anywhere #neveragain
@USAirways even alternate options are allready full...even with hotel voucher...no more room in philly?
@USAirways @traveloneworld .. Utterly frustrated after 4 hours on hold call was disconnected. I need to amend a Flight Booking Problems. HELP! OW Emerald
@USAirways you airline is doing rather poor right now. In SLC waiting to take off. Was suppose to take off now 2 hours and 3 minutes ago!
@USAirways Get new planes then. Got on this plane at 7:50 its 10:20 now and still on tarmac. How ru going to compensate me for this?
@USAirways just hit 4hrs.  what is typical wait time right now? should i drive 2h30m to the airport service desk?
@USAirways are you going to do anything to help stranded travelers of flight 680?! No communication from anyone. All of us dumped here.
@USAirways question is why flight took off at all, now a friend is stuck needlessly in another city
@USAirways #Wronganswer. Talk is cheap. Customer service is the action of making things right for the customer. #fail again.
@USAirways 4 hours . How do I change my flight that was Cancelled Flightled ?
@USAirways actually it landed in BWI 30 minutes ago. She is stranded but I have friends to help. You FAILED big time on this one.
@USAirways I have been on hold for over one hour waiting to reschedule a flight. How much longer should I expect?
@USAirways You landed me at #BWI instead of @Reagan_Airport  and have no plans for me to make it home to DC. How do you suggest I get home?
@USAirways stranded at BWI after two diversions. No cust service, no transport. Dumped here. Terrible customer service!
@USAirways As a member of the news media, the awful service of the last few days won't go unnoticed.
@USAirways My wife, sick 3yr-old-twins, and I have been waiting in line now for 2hrs to see an agent! Phone agent said nothing til Tuesday!
@USAirways This is garbage, been trying to book a reward flight and then it got Cancelled Flighted and still can't get anyone on phone. Unacceptable
@USAirways Delays due to faulty engine light. Great work guys. Coming up on 2 hrs sitting on the plane #WorstAirlineInAmerica
@USAirways I have been I hold for 40 min. My 5:50 flight just got Cancelled Flightled and rescheduled for Monday. This is unacceptable!

@USAirways Flight 496. How are u going to compensate me for sitting on the tarmac for 90+ mins and missing my PHX - BOS connection?
@USAirways on top or having to check my bag I had to wait over 30 min for my bag to come out at baggage claim. Thanks for wasting my time
@USAirways I had to sit in your kitchen and move stuff around so I had what I needed. I'm extremely disappointed in your service
@USAirways been sitting on the tarmac for 90 mins now bc engine is broken. How are u going to compensate passengers #WorstAirline
@USAirways it was your fault the flight was delayed to begin with. I shouldn't have to check my bag if there's a bunch of space
@USAirways it is an extreme inconvenience to make ppl check bags when there's a lot of overhead space left. You lie so you're not at fault
@USAirways stuck on the runway for 2 hrs 10 min due to weather in PHL. Nowhere can I find accurate info on #558 to BOS
@USAirways Yep, except this delay was due to a hasty and unwise decision to pushback other plane before the plows were done. #fail.
@USAirways by far the worst airline in history. I'll never ever fly your garbage again
@USAirways pullin some sh** delaying flights again... Smh @OBJ_3 http://t.co/Av2rfFHMcV
@USAirways @PHLAirport flight 837 landed at 10:30 pm and we are still on the plane. Help!!!!!!
@USAirways TRBL experience! 2 hrs on the Tarmac for an inch of snow IN PHL ""No hanger open"" &amp; ""a pile of snow""?  #terriblecommunication
@USAirways flight 837 passengers stuck on plane in Philly. Where is the gangway?  We can't hear the pilot
@USAirways 2 hours and counting waiting to get into a gate in Philadelphia. Just icing on the cake for a miserable flight experience
@USAirways HELP! It says ""the payment is denied"" but my money has been taken out of my bank?  
And it says I have no trips coming up??
@USAirways not happy w/ app Late Flightly. Last time I flew wouldn't let me check in, This time I checked in went on Late Flightr says I never checked in
@USAirways @AmericanAir how do I get thru on hold over 3 hours ?
@USAirways is flt 680 en route to DCA or BWI after diverting to RDU. Your phone service  sucks and your website is conflicting.
@USAirways how do I change flights . 3 hours is crazy please help
@USAirways how do I get thru on hold 3 hours 5 minutes . Is this normal ? My call is lost
@USAirways weather doesn't excuse poor customer service, lack of info from staff or the fact staff haven't turned up
@USAirways please help on hold 3 hours can't change flights I'm stuck here
@USAirways on hold 3 hours !!!!!! What's the number to speak to someone this is unacceptable I need to change flights
@USAirways he waited over two hours on the phone, had to book and get to MI, family member very ill, time of the essence
@USAirways Can't stress enough how awful the agent was for flight 5283. Knew 11 ppl from delayed flight were on way in mins, no compassion.
@USAirways I certainly understand the hold delays for WX reschedules - I've been on for 2hr15min - do you have an estimated wait time?
@USAirways And cherry on top-flight 880 was on runway after we landed ON TIME for 45 mins. Still didn't get half the luggage.
@USAirways likelihood of PHL to BDL actually leaving tonight? 2 hour delay so far!
@USAirways My brother &amp; his family stranded in CLT tonight bc gate E36 agent wouldn't hold plane for two minutes. Now driving in bad weather
@USAirways over an hour is unacceptable wait time. thanks for nothing.  Be sure never to fly you again
@USAirways understood. It simply feels as if the staff is not being entirely truthful about the situation.
@USAirways #not happy, wife 40th Bday trip. would like to be fully compensated for both flights
@USAirways delayed in philly since 130, sitting onTarmac since 8pm flight 1881 plz contact donaldaroberts1@gmail.com
@USAirways worst trip ever!  Wish pilot would've let me off plane at 12pm during 1st delay.  Now 1030pm and still sitting on runway.
@USAirways so far no call back
@USAirways standing in line with 100 people all looking to do the same
@USAirways cannot book to redeem companion fair without speaking to agent. $99 vs $1200, this is a family emergency #unacceptable
@USAirways can I at least get a response?  I tried the gate person (sent me the wrong way to cust srvc ) Cust Srvc (when I found them)
@USAirways That's clever. Its clear you need more agents. 94 min hold and counting. Flex workforces are highly possible in 2015
@USAirways hey folks where do you hide luggage when you Cancelled Flight a flight! You have 100 very angry people with no luggage
@USAirways thanks for letting me know of the 12 hour delay and 2 hours on hold ?
@USAirways please respond to me. I've been on hold on the reservations line for an hour and 45 minutes. I would really appreciate it.
@USAirways From here on out when I can at all I'm flying @Delta. Since when is a plane getting stuck in a drift for 2 hours a weather issue?
@USAirways on hold for 1 hour and 14 min trying to find the luggage flight Cancelled Flightled where is luggage? http://t.co/i1SfMI7zat
@USAirways Never mind that you could have told the gate I was on my way - you could delay 10 mins but not 15?
@USAirways  and now I'm going to miss my G'ma's Memorial because I didn't #FlyDelta.
@USAirways @usairways -Really? U land me in Philly 1.5 hours before my flight, wait 1.5 hours behind a plane you got stuck,
@USAirways Your app and website are trash AF.
@USAirways how about an update with real information?still waiting on Tarmac in Philadelphia.
@usairways you mean 10:30pm. I'd be in vegas by now if I'd been allowed on my original flight.

@USAirways @rylietolbert15 wow you wouldn't say
“@USAirways: @TMadCLE We don't like to hear this. We're sorry that it's taking so long to get through.” Stop sending generic responses
@USAirways sucks.  Flt 2692 Late Flight by 20 mins missed my connection.  Thanks for the 10 bucks and a middle seat on the next flt.
.@USAirways worst experience of all time. Will never, ever, ever travel with you again. EVER
@USAirways So you Cancelled Flightled my flight AGAIN? are you paying for my hotel?!
@USAirways something is wrong with your phone system if you call someone and don't play the recorded flight notification. Is US643 Late Flight?
@USAirways hell is terrible gate agents. And a three hour wait at the gate.
@USAirways I made the change online, but couldn't check-in online, so had to call (3 hrs on hold btw). Shouldn't have been charged $25
@USAirways nervous for flight tomrw out of key west not friendly customer service
@USAirways I was calling before I left, and as it turns out @united answered their phones instead and they rebooked my USAir flight.
@USAirways @AmericanAir won't even refund for a flight they Cancelled Flightled #horriblecustomerservice
@USAirways call dropped &amp; no call back...another 45min-hour for another rep. The worst CS ever, online, by phone &amp; in person.
@USAirways why the hell u left *alliance and joined 1world is beyond me not a smart move time to start looking at other carriers
@USAirways and apologies are thin when you don't even offer hotel vouchers to your stranded customers.
@USAirways I did. They told me it was a 40 min wait &amp; they'd call back. It's already been 45 min. Horrible
@USAirways but only for certain flights from CLT-NYC. The notion that you can't rebook customers for 48 hours is absurd.
@USAirways disappointed with your toll free number. Terrible customer service, my flight has been Cancelled Flightled would like to get home
@USAirways it a change fee request from a month ago.  after one hour on phone with your team, I’m told 120 day backlog.  Awful.
@USAirways flt last nght Cancelled Flighted-mech.probs, flt this am Cancelled Flighted-snow, finally on a flt home. 1st cls empty &amp; they won't let me sit there
@USAirways you're killing me sche a flight to board 3 min after mine arrived with gate on other side of airport #genious
@USAirways @AmericanAir 9 empty seats open in 1st on AA1061. No upgrades for a U.S. Gold member? Would love consistent policies.
@USAirways status shows ""delayed"" it was just ""waiting for takeoff"" so did it depart? It certainly didn't at 4:17pm. http://t.co/emRUbu4WzD
@USAirways you're right it's not fun. Especially when I don't have much of a choice. Lol. #curvygirltravels
@USAirways AND my rebooked flt isn't until Monday??  AND I don't get a voucher for a hotel?!  Never again, US airways.
@USAirways how is it that my flt to EWR was Cancelled Flightled yet flts to NYC from USAirways are still flying?
@USAirways @AmericanAir Flight SF to NYC only made it to Philly. Ur customer service is telling me no refund for the last leg? #offensive
@USAirways I was told a ""return call"" by a human
@USAirways @PHLAirport Cancelled Flighted flight due to weather no problem, but wait for luggage for 4 hours?? IT MUST BE DELIVERED!!
@USAirways comin in clutch and sending me to Charlotte then home, I h8 u @AmericanAir, except for Wayne u a real g #ThankJesus #ThankMe
@USAirways Every time I try, the line is disconnected b/c the system says you have too many calls. Glad your screw up matters so much to you
@USAirways, another hour gone &amp; they sit with more snow on them! Seriously?! http://t.co/Fupf0UAyir
@USAirways already did. I travel for a living, no help at all that it will take 3-4 weeks for any repair. And I have to pay to ship to TX.
@USAirways We did. @AmericanAir said to open one with you, too.
@USAirways to a booked hotel for the night so I had to find him a room at midnight. Then say his bags will be on the plane, but can't (2/3)
@USAirways This is ridiculous. You delayed my husband's flights &amp; made him miss his connection. Told him to leave his bags. Sent him (1/3)
@USAirways Been tweeting with the team at @AmericanAir who informed me that the problem is that you never sent his bags to them yesterday.
@USAirways Your Baggage system has hung up on me twice because you have too many callers. I NEED TO FIND MY HUSBAND'S (@SweetingR) BAGS.
@USAirways haven't eaten all day either so lemme get that CC# so I can buy a burger across from the terminal.  #DoBetter @UsAirwaysSuck
@USAirways looking forward to waiting on hold for 9 hrs to reschedule my flight.  Bunch of idiots work for this airline.
@USAirways you guys straight up suck ass
@USAirways still Effin waiting... Not weather delays, not engine trouble, but lack of crew?  Are you shitting me?
@USAirways i have been trying ALL WEEK to book a multi city award trip (can't book online) I'm told to call back some other time. What?!?
@USAirways -beg to differ. 4 things booked wrong and still not fixed. Get your act together! #USAirSucks
@timbennettg3 @USAirways Cancelled Flightled 4532 sch departure 8:38 am, wasn't snowing yet and other flights were still leaving #Fail
@USAirways  And now your half assed plane is falling apart. Some one tell my family I love them! #DoBetter http://t.co/UA6doUA34l
@USAirways is the 7th circle of hell right after the dmv. #noshadetothedmv
@USAirways thanks for the seat that doesn't recline. I'm shocked I'm not being asked to serve everyone drinks on the plane.  #DoBetter
@USAirways it's been three weeks since I was specifically told I would get a call back from your folks in AZ- should I keep being patient?
@USAirways #Unbelievable that for 2 consecutive days I can't get through to a person.  On hold over 2 hours and still going
@USAirways you are cutting into my pregame time.  Go @KentuckyMBB !!!!
@USAirways What's the seat assignment policy? Why let us choose a seat only to change it on us two weeks Late Flightr?
@USAirways Yes, it's February. Bad weather happens every winter. If you guys don't have the business sense to forecast that I'm at a loss.
@USAirways I called twice the recording says that it has being delivered to my apt but it is not here ?
@USAirways  in don't have it on me at the time as I am taking Amtrak home. How do we call for partial refunds?
@USAirways 4+ hour hold, finally Cancelled Flighted ticket! sticking to @delta @Expedia who allow easy online Cancelled Flights/refunds! http://t.co/RKVCZBpdCE
@USAirways now what? You Cancelled Flightled my flight again... Are you paying for my hotel?
@USAirways had baggage lost last night, no call from us airways and no bags and nobody answering phone #badcustomersrvice #whereismybag

@USAirways been on hold for 39 minutes and counting for a month old change fee refund request for a funeral.  This is pathetic.
@USAirways after 5 flight Cancelled Flightlations we finally get a flight, get to the gate on time &amp; you've given our seats away? Seriously??
@USAirways the American Eagle plane you're using for CLT to RDU is disgusting! You should be ashamed! #disgusting #ew http://t.co/B4xhiRuGzV
@USAirways undermines the intelligence of customers by ignoring their complaints with their copy and paste canned responses #usairwaysfail
@USAirways providing poor customer service by responding to complaints with a copy and paste tempLate Flight unreLate Flightd to complaint #usairwaysfail
@USAirways I've been on hold for over 2 1/2 hours - there has to be an easier way to Cancelled Flight/get a refund...  http://t.co/Cm4roIypc2
@USAirways enormous lines at customer service and two agents what kind of service is that .. http://t.co/ffanixJhwh
@USAirways Inexcusable behavior by gate agent. Sorry isn't enough. #Flight850 #CLT-#BNA
@USAirways chose you for a flight with very time sensitive arrival And you drop the ball. What gives? CLT #667 good way to lose my business
@USAirways I'm trying to Cancelled Flight my flight within the 24hr window but have been on hold for over an hour. Is there an alternate # I can dial?
@USAirways i've been on hold for an hour trying to change my flight!!! COME ON
@USAirways what happens if the flight takes off before we Cancelled Flight?? That's the issue. We don't want to pay because of your inaccessibility!
@USAirways I'm assisting @marccopely. He is already rebooked. Agents rude, unhelpful, discourteous. #FrequentFlyers appalled. Unacceptable!!
@usairways  this is ridiculous at CLT  and we missed our connecting flight because of a chuckhole  on runway??  #shameful (1/1)
@USAirways no one at #clt knows about runway issues..my inbound flight was only one delayed..connection left without me..now I'm stuck!
@USAirways flight 850. RUDE RUDE RUDE service! Awful.
@USAirways what is with all the Cancelled Flightlations to PBI? We have pax at DCA that have been sent to 4 different lines between AAL and AWE. Help!

Hey @USAirways based on the number of retweets and likes on my FB post, it's nice to know I'm not alone in my frustrations with you guys!
@USAirways seems to be the only airline without a dedicated line for status members
@usairways I just learned that although there is travel policy and they waive the change fee-you will still be charged a $25 reservation fee
@USAirways gold desk quoting me $900 to rebook due to weather. Can buy first seat on same flight for $440. Why? On hold for 45+ mins now
@USAirways @PRof_Solutions Be prepared for 3+ hours hold times
@USAirways Sadly your words don't represent your company's actions. Talk is cheap.
@USAirways trying to Cancelled Flight a flight urgently...get hung up on twice??? Sweet refund policy

@USAirways - I'm currently missing a basketball game due to your lost bag policy #terribleservice #wheresmyrefund
@USAirways your flight attendants are all jerks 
@USAirways Easily the most ridiculous experience trying to spend money with your company.
@USAirways Was told it was a software bug. Told to call back this AM  Now your system is too busy to handle any calls this AM.  Clown shoes.
@USAirways - been on hold with reservations for over 30 min already! #worstairline
@USAirways now the 3rd issue with the plane is a fuel leak. They will let us know soon what they decide. #getmeoffthisplane #ineedabeer

@usairways when trying to check-in online, it says to call...now I've been on hold for 2 hours...what to do?
@USAirways how long are you going make us sit in this plane while they repair it? Could I at least get a beer???
@usairways I've been on hold for approaching 2 hrs for an issue when I changed my ticket online. Frustrating.
@USAirways on hold for 1hr, 30min. Not willing to hang in there as long as @franchise02. @AmericanAir answered in 7 min. U are not 1 yet.
@USAirways 2 hours and 7 minutes. Just want to know I'm still in the queue...
@USAirways check in at St. Louis is so rude, even the TSA is nicer than them.
@USAirways so disappointed. Least you could do is give us access to admirals club for an hour before our flight to our wedding!
@USAirways paid to upgrade to first class, went up to Admirals club at PHX airport to be turned away because our flight is to CUN and not MC
@USAirways can you please post wait time-have been on hold for two hours
@USAirways Saying my friend missed her flight when she clearly sat next to me on the plane &amp; now you're Cancelled Flighting her flight home.. WTF!?
@USAirways or is anyone even responding to social media? AWFUL.
@USAirways I'm on vacation, This is the LAST thing I want to be doing. Is anyone even answering the phone?
@USAirways I fucking hate your customer service. I've been on hold all morning trying to figure out why you Cancelled Flighted my flight.
@USAirways DCA to RSW at 8:30am Cancelled Flightled.  Rebook to Charlotte Cancelled Flightled.  Can we rebook selves online???
@USAirways baggage drop at phl b/c is incredibly backed up... unacceptable service
@USAirways trying 2 fly frm DCA to SRQ to visit a family member in hospice but 4532 was Cancelled Flightled, can someone assist me?
@USAirways I don't want a reservation change, just adding a service. Am going public with this to get help.
All followers please note that @USAirways is not taking customer service calls, nor responding by helping via soc. media #dontflyusairways
@USAirways your checkin at @PHLAirport is a #shitshow, and the agent behind the counter who tried to send me to the wrong destination=rude!
@USAirways Sitting on the runway at phl for the last 30 min because the correct weights for the flight aren't in the system? #jobfail
@USAirways any guesstimate on hold times? Can't change my flight online, at 45 mins and counting...
@USAirways Trying to change my flight due to NYC travel advisory... your online system Cancelled Flighted my entire flight. Been on hold for over 1 hr
@USAirways yes. But the manner with which it was done was harsh for those affected. Already checked in. No remorse. Weak alternatives.
@USAirways told to work it out ourselves #joke #fail
@USAirways incapable of seating a 2yo and mom together. Toddler in his own row #fail @CNN
@USAirways bumping people off a flight ten minutes before takeoff because the flight is overbooked #fail
@USAirways you call this a window seat? #airbus321seat14Fproblems http://t.co/ZKOE6clGiU
@USAirways you've completely ruined a pro athlete's ability to prepare for a race. Now you won't help him get the bike he needs to the DR?!
@USAirways Cool. Now @SweetingR has been told you can't re-route his bags after he was told to leave them last night. He needs them to race.
@USAirways quick, let's board a plane so that we can sit on runway for 2 hours #clockwork #scareways #neverfails @AUmilo1
@USAirways Also, get excited, because he's going to be unable to contact you all from his destination, so you get to talk to me.
@USAirways It's pretty hilarious that you want @SweetingR to finish his awful experience before doing something. Make it right, now.
@USAirways u would think if u were going to Cancelled Flight my flight, you'd rebook our seats to something other than the last row. #usairwaysfail
@USAirways no online clearly states I can NOT- It says to call res. I already explained that.
@USAirways Oh yes, because I had loads of time running to my connecting flight after you delayed me for about 90 minutes...
@USAirways Hey, my bag was damaged flying with you yesterday. What can I do?
@USAirways @AmericanAir flight 849's four subsequent delays destroyed my travel plans this evening. Looking to resolve this matter.
@USAirways I did at 7 pm! Still no bag..
@USAirways Congrats, you've just lost a customer for good. When I made a United weather change, free/5 min. You guys 2 hrs on hold &amp; $25.
@USAirways So when was I supposed to call the Internet Desk? Especially since my reservation told me to directly call the main 1-800 number?
@USAirways Not only did u lose the flight plan! Now ur flight crew is FAA timed out! Thx for havin us sit on the tarmac for an hr! #Pathetic
@USAirways I've been on hold for 75 minutes waiting to talk to someone about my flight tomorrow. Is there another number to call?
@USAirways ...YOU ARE DESPICABLE! The flight plan was lost! Now we've been sitting on the tarmac for an hour! Its a 45 min flight!
@USAirways Can you help me update KTN on the profile?  Ticket book via AA &amp; that info didn't get pass on.  I've been on hold forever
@USAirways How the heck does one get the Internet desk to authorize a waiver? Would that involved being on hold for another hour?
@USAirways so am I supposed to discuss this matter with a computer? #BadCustomerService #Airlines #DividendRewards
@USAirways &gt;250k miles on usair.  Last four flights not good. Other airlines much improved. Billing issues, seats, legroom, in air service.
@USAirways It says to call. Before connecting, get song, dance about weather. Weather bad 3 days? Called for 2 days before. #wasteoftime
@USAirways REALLY? Tried that already-got message not available to do. Next idea?
@USAirways I'm glad you're sorry that I'm homeless for the night. Makes me feel secure.
@USAirways wonder if this misery is considered a damage in a breach of contract lawsuit #lawyerup
@USAirways at which point in told they have sold my voucher because I wasn't fast enough
@USAirways the kind gentleman at the gate tells me to ""go left"" to get my hotel voucher at the ticket gate. Took about 20min to get there
@USAirways I have a story for you. It starts with a two hour delayed flight that makes me miss my connection in Miami.
@USAirways -doing best??? Think not. Lousy way to run an airline. Why no online way to connect? You be on hold for 2hrs &amp; then zip
@USAirways flight scheduled for 730pm...told at 150am that flight is Cancelled Flightled after sitting on cold plane for 2 hours.
@USAirways refuses to compensate passengers when inconvenienced and wouldn't even rebook me on another airline. #disappointed
@USAirways Can you tell me why I waited 90 mins and then was charged the $25 phone change fee even tho I wasn't allow to make change online?
@USAirways @stephenrodrick Your team needs to build capacity
@USAirways I will write CR. Not sure what good it'll do as the customer service I experienced was horrible.
@USAirways -1st x told no travel advisory-now TWO hrs on hold &amp; disconnected. Fl from BHM to Charlotte to PHL won't go-HELP!!!
@USAirways Made about 30 calls to USAir today to merge of AAdvantage, Dividend Miles. Each time, says call back Late Flightr. #30timesenough
@USAirways fuck you.
@USAirways I'm dumping this dividend miles card and forgetting your airline exists #ridiculous #theworstairlineever
@USAirways How dirty does the damn plane have to be to take an hour to get the plane cleaned??? Refund me my miles. #wasteoftime #theworst
@USAirways worst customer service I've ever experienced. I'll never fly your airline ever again. I have to pay to sleep in Philly. Fuck you.
@USAirways Ever sit on hold and just lose track of time? http://t.co/Yqhk8LJaBN
@USAirways us air should be ashamed of this service - on hold for hours? No help from any representative just to reschedule due to weather ?
@usairways now on hold for an hour. So frustrating, I suspect you have more operators come in on days like this w/inclement weather?
@USAirways - the worst! Hold time crazy, agents horrible, no accountability! #USAIRsucks
@USAirways Website won't let me change online even though airline issued travel advisory, now on hold for 50 minutes. Help.
@USAirways  you were always my go to. What happened?  Airbus over Boeing, and now no customer service?
@USAirways trying to change flight because of airline travel advisory. on hold for 45 mins. Help!
@USAirways would be less annoying if road conditions weren't getting worse with every min U keep passengers captive for no good reason.
@USAirways literally the worst flying experience of my life, and I have flown a lot
@usairways I purchased a $49 upgrade on a flight 2 weeks ago and you gave it to someone else but I have not received a refund. Is this SOP?
@USAirways figure it out, have had 2 Cancelled Flightled flights in the past week. Now coming home 2 hour delay, and cart that pulls plane just broke
@USAirways 45 minutes on hold no help
@USAirways flight #3797 treatment of passengers has been atrocious - over 2 hours delay only to now deplane and given no direction
@USAirways express my disappointment in your reservation department and the treatment of a Sailor dealing with a death in the family
@USAirways talked to Supervisor Jeanine and she couldn't help me. 45 minutes of talking to her and nothing.
@USAirways i thought @united was the worst airline but nah. You guys are far worse. Is @Delta the only decent airline out there?
@USAirways @keithlaw  I flew US Air for the first time yesterday, got propositioned by the flight attendant....true story!  #Creditcardsales
@USAirways 13 years of Naval Service and I run the travel department for all my commands...
@USAirways US Airways website. So you double charge people when they book flights now? Apparently you have but I've never been booked twice
@USAirways new slogan should be ""if you don't want to arrive on time, pick us""
@USAirways you have to be crazy! Treated my mom very poorly. Not happy! #usairwaysfail
@USAirways they weren't able to without reFlight Booking Problems and recharging the amount plus $25 fee for help over phone. Spoke to 2 agents &amp; Jeanine
@USAirways This is the last time I use your airline. I promise that!
@USAirways @AmericanAir I was supposed to get from fresno to pittsburgh by 10pm.  Instead I'm now not getting in until 4pm... tomorrow
@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm stuck in the airport in fresno trying to beat the storm to pittsburgh, and you guys have offered nothing. HORRID
@USAirways hello I have a question for you and your phone lines have jammed
@USAirways @AmericanAir u are the worst airline ever figure out the merger #dontmakemegooutside
@USAirways / @AmericanAir are incompetent.
@USAirways Now the next plane had a broken seat!  My row!  Another hour delay!  #mad
@USAirways how can I make a purchase, you take the money but I don't have a reservation...Explain
@USAirways @AmericanAir thought u merged but #USAirways sucks #worstever http://t.co/myNZitCovn
@USAirways  2 hours on hold and issue still not resolved. hope to make my flight in 12 hours. for every minute of talk = 20 minutes of hold
@USAirways worst customer service experience ever today. Get it together.
@USAirways I know some folks have to use your airlines but doesn't customer service ever matter? I really hate to complain but it's brutal!
@USAirways im on the plane not sure what you mean. We are sitting here. It's just one story of failure after another when I fly you guys
@USAirways still waiting #brokenpromises #notnice #neveragain #tellyourstory
@USAirways your team was just terrifyingly rude to a young mother &amp; her baby trying to check in to a flight from PHX to JWA. Help her out.
@USAirways them and @AmericanAir
@USAirways rudest crew member experience! Throwing shade and calling out customers. #reachingnewlows
@USAirways @AmericanAir terminal E in Miami is still the worst most smelly airport ever. Thanks for nothing.
@USAirways I did &amp; was told I asked to many questions. bag might still be on flight 413. Should be easy to check when it lands in Seattle.
@USAirways Cancelled Flightled our original flight to aruba. Now on the way home we were told we don't have seats. Never flying @usairways again
@USAirways here we go again. Same flight as last week. Delayed already 45 mins. Think the 7:15 can leave PHL before 1:15 am? #waitingagain
@USAirways stuck on Tarmac for hour an a half and told longer to go and no hotels available when we land in Phoenix #unacceptable #unhappy
@USAirways not happening #worstairlineever also Marie Burroughs is the worst customer service rep ever #yourairlinesucks
@USAirways technical issues = inefficient computer triage system. Personality/ compassion of operators = not. Sad example of sad company.
@USAirways you suck and you ruined my day. And my vacation isn't even until June.
@USAirways 2 bad planes &amp; 3 gate changes= lots of exercise. #travelfail let's hope this plane works. I'm tired.
@usairways and @american please get my plane together before I go to Jetblue
@USAirways it MIGHT have went through. No confirmation. ""Please wait"" then same form.
@USAirways found the tix#, security code not working. Tried a dozen times.
@USAirways Nightmarish customer service. Further to that, as an elite member, I'm appalled.
@USAirways I have never been given a number for elite for usair. Only AA. I waited for 3 hours for an answer and by then my seat was gone.
@USAirways @AmericanAir can someone please tell me who I have to talk to #getittogether #findurgrip
Is it insulting that @USAirways @AmericanAir offer a ""non required $50 voucher as a goodwill offering..At least my bag can fly round trip
@USAirways I'm trying to Request Missed Mileage and it keeps saying it can't my flight from 2/13. Then it says call the number.
@USAirways flight 413 my carryon is missing.stollen off plane or left at gate. Worst customer service. Doesn't seem to be anyone's concern.
@USAirways how about checking the plane before having everyone board the plane? #pissed
@USAirways link didn't work via Mobil.
@USAirways Wishing we had our luggage. 2 days now. Had to pay our way from St Thomas to San Juan. Spent extra $$$ because of this mess up.
@USAirways How do I get through?
@USAirways @AmericanAir who runs the show at the airport have a boarding pass says us airways and I have to wait in American line #yousuck
@USAirways why I can't book a flight to PRN through your website?
@USAirways this is ridiculous #planebroken can't wait to board this one home 5 hours Late Flightr #neverontime #brutal #paymytab
@USAirways since when does a maintenance problem and missing flight crew equal delayed due to weather? I'm confused since we had sunny skies
@USAirways I keep calling your help line (800) 428-4322 and it keeps saying they are too busy to help &amp; to call back Late Flightr. FOR A WEEK NOW!
@USAirways more lies, they said in their email we were delayed due to weather when the sky was clear in the city we were departing.
@nrhodes85: look! Another apology. DO NOT FLY @USAirways
@USAirways it's painful being on hold to you!! Really 25 minutes to change a flight!! http://t.co/ocqk0JFXuA
@USAirways I did, but i need to get a human being. What's the fastest way to achieve this? All I get is a computer.
@USAirways Batting 1.000! Four flights in a month, all four delayed!
@USAirways &amp; also that I was told no comps, upgrades, etc. ReFlight Booking Problems is good enough. #usairwaysfail
@USAirways I was... 4 tomorrow. I missed my meeting today, &amp; it was pointless 2 pay hotel today when the purpose of my trip has been screwed
@USAirways and next flight delayed as well. 5238 out of Charlotte, is it just my luck or what?
@USAirways fight was delayed 3 hrs in MCO, now I'm stuck in Philly with a standby ticket, flight 4009. Solution needed.
@USAirways Know what I like about gate 35X @NationalAirpor ? Nothin.I like nothin bout yo #ghettofab gate #USAirways http://t.co/mAqw2nLNiU
@USAirways I've tried calling 3 times the past 3 days and I keep getting told to call back. SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME
@USAirways gate agent in CLT forced me to check bag in z1 &amp; proceeded to allow larger bags. Huge inconvenience to travel plans.
@USAirways worst customer service. ticket was 180 and fee is 200 it's ""not worth it"" for them accommodate me given circumstances in BOS
@USAirways see? No response? Obviously you think this ""service"" is acceptable. #customerservicefail
“@USAirways: We're sincerely sorry, Sean. Reservations is working hard to answer everyone's call and we appreciate your patience.” #false
@USAirways It wasn't weather this morning.  AWE1701 diverted back to BOS due to mechanical issues.  So far lost one of 3 days :(
@USAirways I have been in contact with 3 people and still no answers. You keep sending me to @Expedia and they keep sending me to you!
@USAirways @AmericanAir no one appreciates the sass of the gate agent at Gate C38 at LGA flight US626. Irritated customers
@USAirways waiting for bags now over 25min in Phl bag claim!
@USAirways flight is already over. I think the airline should just have the flight attendants actually emphasize that VAPE is still smoking
@USAirways Call volumes are high so the best answer is to hang up on me?
@USAirways yes but lost a whole day.  Frustrating!!  #poor customer service
@USAirways Saddens me that my first tweet - ever - has to be a complaint about customer service.
@USAirways trying to check in online for a flight tomorrow.  Tried computer, tablet, and phone.  got error message on all devices?
@USAirways @AmericanAir How do I merge my miles accounts? Your sites tell me my info don't match even though I can't find a difference.
@USAirways yes had to go pick up and pay 40 cab ride very rude employee poor customer service
@USAirways your staff at LAX really messed up on this one. Failing to scan my suitcase tag.
@USAirways Not happy with start of trip!  Cancelled Flightled flight #poor customerservice
@USAirways I called the BTV desk; they had more information - so it exists.  Your systems don't make it easy for the customer to access it.
@USAirways that website does not give correct info said my bag was in Miami was in key west the entire time..I got the run around for 2 days
@USAirways was on hold for about 45 minutes after speaking 2 lady at the airport counter. Gave up
@USAirways I just want to find my bag so I won't have to go through the hassle of trying to claim what was in my suitcase #usairwaysfail
@USAirways Literally all that says is ""Case open""  What good is that to me?
@USAirways no you not sorry. I am trying 2 add a day 2 my vacation but there is a $200 charge just 2 change flights
@USAirways the two women workng PHL bag check term C @ 11:30 ET should be fired for being rude, pushy and treating customers with disrespect
@sarahpompei don't bother wasting your time!  @USAirways will send u a form letter &amp; let u choose a gift certificate. #worstcustomerservice
@USAirways and now that flight pushed back to 2:35pm departure.
@USAirways -not just this trip, been a few. Ur saving grace is ur cheaper flights. Now willing to pay more 4 bttr service on bttr airlines.
@USAirways horrible experience to key west lost luggage called to check &amp; was told not to call back reconsidering my flight back
@USAirways I needed to be at my destination by lunchtime today. No one could get us on a flight, but I've since learned @Delta had one!
@USAirways delayed I'm charlotte big surprise
@USAirways Cancelled Flightled flight, 50 person line and one agent helping to rebook. You could've handed this one better. http://t.co/By3vDioSUA
@AndrewFallis same here! On hold for an hour &amp; then told @USAirways has done all it is willing to- which was apologize. #stillnotonmyflight
@USAirways what is happening with flight 1701 from BOS to PHL? Daughter and her fiancée are stuck in BOS!
@nrhodes85 isn't it funny that @USAirways just apologizes, but doesn't actually take steps 2 go above &amp; beyond for customers? #NotImpressed
@USAirways 2133. Flight now Cancelled Flightled. Have been rebooked on 2pm flight. If on time take off, I'll have spent 5 extra hours at DCA.
@USAirways We've been sitting on this plane for almost an hour, waiting for it to be fueled. Shouldn't that have been done b4 we got on????
@USAirways can I get a free mimosa to compensate my flight delay (yet again) thx
@USAirways get ur act together, start treating ur passengers w/ kinder, have more sanitized planes. Take a page from @Delta perhaps.
@USAirways is a joke. Stop losing my luggage!
@USAirways I've been on hold for 35 mins to sort out my reservation out of sync message when trying to check in, what's wrong?!?
@USAirways has no idea what customer service means.  As the customer, if you mess up my plans, don't treat me like its no big deal!
@USAirways Still on hold. 1 hour and 45 minutes and counting. Platinum? Who cares? Problems checking in? Who cares?
@USAirways how about a little help for the two gate agents trying to rebook flight 1707?
@USAirways I respect the stress of a merger but one rep to reschedule/replane 15 ppl who are already Late Flight? #youcandobetter
@USAirways now I am on flight to FLL, and told to take a train back to PBI to get my car. There are no trains to PBI!
@USAirways Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I'm so displeased.
@USAirways headed to NYC from CLT. Funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more).
@USAirways I already let them know and sent 4 complaints.  Got a call back finally when I was asleep and there is no return call back #
@USAirways the flights weren't from this morning... It was 4 flights 2 on Thursday and 2 on Monday which turned into Tuesday
@USAirways I spoke with a customer service rep who was rude and curt and transferred me to eternal hold. Sad. #badservice #mergerdisaster
@USAirways your customer service is a nightmare. I have been on hold for 1 hour. I'm a platinum member with AA and feel like it's worthless
@USAirways never let's me down, every. Single. Flight. Gets delayed.
@USAirways I've been standing on a very crowded bus for the past 30 mins for DCA-PIT. HELP! @AmericanAir http://t.co/jasKYPLWt5
@USAirways Thanks, but you can't. My flight was Cancelled Flightled for ""maintenance"" reasons, and the next available flight was too Late Flight for me.
@USAirways yes, I was rebooked the next day (Weds). Thanks. Just upset that I lost 2 additional work days AND paid for my own hotel. #losing
@USAirways suppose I need to tweet everyone how horrible your airline is for you to take notice. Let me try that route.
@USAirways No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of “We don’t care. We’re automated.""
@USAirways @AmericanAir , you Cancelled Flightled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of $8.51/ticket from PHL to EWR, really?!
@USAirways now the plane is 100 degrees and we are burning up. This is completely illegal.
@USAirways now siting on Tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn't help. This is terrible.
@USAirways what is the damn delay????
@USAirways it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here
@usairways app is the worst one for airlines. Can't do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless.
@USAirways has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday!
@USAirways And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless.
.@USAirways You'll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again.
@Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!
@Usairways need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at #gsp, and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!
@USAirways that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service
@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate
@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout
@USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice
@USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous
@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.
@USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay.
@USAirways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half.
@USAirways I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight.
@USAirways this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air
@USAirways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn't even let us off.
@USAirways hi is there somebody avail who can help .....with an refund ? its unbelievable on the phone w US for more than 7 hrs in 4 days
@USAirways ordered a Scotch &amp; water and F/A asked if I wanted full glass or half? 60 yrs old and first time ever asked that????
@USAirways yeah, the mark was like a mile back. Also we're an hour Late Flight. So thanks a ton for the great service today.
@USAirways we got 1 drink then F/A sat in jump seat doing crosswords. Glasses picked up at landing. Just a very lazy service 4 First class.
@USAirways First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging 1st drink service 50 min after take off
@USAirways you told us last night that there was a ground stop at O'Hare FOUR HOURS AFTER Obama landed, stop blaming someone else
@USAirways #428 delayed due to #frozentoilet #medicalissue #mechanicalissue #dispatchissue We've heard it all! #LetsGo
@USAirways ""Able""? Does that mean not having private conversations and not helping those w/ luggage that won't fit overhead?
@USAirways is the worst. 45 minute delay in Boston. Not weather reLate Flightd. Going to miss our connecting flight. Gassing up the plane issue.
@USAirways is the worst!! Still haven't left.. Everyone missing connections.
@USAirways today's flight to Philadelphia.  It's a little disappointing for the unnecessary delays and it's not even snowing in FL.
@USAirways I have been trying to book a flight using my miles for 3 straight days. 210 min on phone - still haven't talked to a human.
@USAirways gonna miss connecting flight.. Delayed flying out of Boston
@USAirways on flight 1839 waiting for weight and balance info for the past 30 minutes!!!
@USAirways thanks for taking my flight off the board AND NOT PROVIDING and updates about my flight which is 26 minutes Late Flight.
@USAirways NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3dDQq0gQni
.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.
@USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!
@USAirways this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
@USAirways been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!
@USAirways it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due  to mechanical.
@USAirways never flying #USAirways again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service.
@USAirways unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn't be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time.
@USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad
@USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.
@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes
@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.
@USAirways offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!
@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA
@USAirways that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us
@USAirways that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice
@USAirways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to ""choose"" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors
@USAirways I’ll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/
@USAirways worst experience ever with you guys…see my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better.
@USAirways now the freezing bus is just doing circles?
@USAirways please explain, I have plenty of time since I'm STRANDED!!
@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice.
@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?
@USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?
@USAirways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.
@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?
@USAirways DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; 1 announcement 4 &gt; hour!
@USAirways I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket.
@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful
@USAirways never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays.
@USAirways my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? #FlyDelta
@USAirways Flights 890 was the delay, Flight 5136 was my missed connection… Help!
@USAirways even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won't be that difficult am sure #disappointed
@USAirways yes .not sure how you guys don't know gate is occupied and keep us waiting
@USAirways Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee 75$ I hope you all end up on unemployment.
@USAirways - BOS -&gt; DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs
@USAirways sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I've come to expect.
@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
@USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??
@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!
@USAirways we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home.
@USAirways ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight, and now we are stranded.
@USAirways flight 728 from PHL to London has been sitting on the tarmac for 46min w/NO further update from the pilot. what gives???
@USAirways I already HAVE, four times
@USAirways 42 minutes holding. Seriously, if your average wait time is over 30 minutes then maybe, just maybe, you're understaffed.
@USAirways Seriously??? I have shared my concerns four times already, to NO avail!  Geeeeezzzzz! #frustrated flyer
@USAirways No hot food on a 5 hour flight? Crazy. Couldn't eat in PHL b/c our original connection was 40 min Late Flight. What gives? #PHLtoLAS
@USAirways Seriously, flight delay Cinci to Philly due to new ground staff, miss connection to MAN UK and now have to argue for hotel. WTF
@USAirways thank you for continuing to be the worst airline out. Didn't need that extra hour of sleep after 29 hours of travel anyway
@USAirways  #USAirways disappoints AGAIN! #Cancelled Flighted flights #Missed appointments #Promised refund is a lie
@USAirways 45 minutes on hold waiting to speak with an agent !! Come on #USAirways !!! Ridiculous #baggagelost #usairways
@USAirways unable to locate baggage, this is frustrating. All my sons clothes and needs in it. #zfv #yyz #usairways #baggagelost
@USAirways I already did. My question is, why does it still say in progress on @AskPayPal? It's been 6 days.
@USAIRWAYS ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Bad customer service, folks. Flew from PSP to PHX flight 2692 on 2/19. (cont) http://t.co/KigfKVXxDQ
@USAirways still no rep can talk 3 days Late Flightr. U r asking me to checkin to my flight tmrw and my refund is being requested.  Deal w this!!
@USAirways flight 1777 has been waiting for 30 minutes at RSW waiting for weight balance clearance. Come on, let us leave!
@USAirways @AskPayPal When will it be marked ""completed"". I'm scared I'm going to lose my reservation or my money is going to be refunded.
@USAirways @AskPayPal completed. If that's the case then why does it still say ""in progress"" on Paypal's website. I reserved on the 13th.
@USAirways Appreciate the calls when flight's delayed, but the recorded msg is tedious &amp; just goes on &amp; on. I vote for texts if practical :)
@USAirways HORRIBLE communication on delayed flight out of LGA!!!! I got 2 emails in seconds w different delay times!!!! HORRIBLE
@USAirways 45 min hold time then a hang up by Manager Mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the Us air CC and status.
@USAirways platinum flyer bought tkt in AA. Also both accounts are linked. So WHY can't I check in for flight tomorrow?
@UsAirways  your person taking tickets is rude and now we are delayed 4-50 minutes because you overfilled fuel on the plane #500.
@USAirways flight 500 out of Seattle has 10,000lbs too much fuel and no water for the lavoratories. Nice job guys - est 40min behind now
@USAirways @AmericanAir Total lack of cust. service for a mom flying solo w. baby. Will not be flying w. Am. Air again!!!
@USAirways pure anarchy on flight 555 to SLC. People walking in with nothing packed in bags with arms full of stuff. #getittogether
@USAirways i tried it but doesnt help very much and Reservation seems to be overwhelmed with some issues
@USAirways should take a lesson from @SouthwestAir and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame..
@USAirways they say connections are good still...but another reFlight Booking Problems is the last thing I need today
@USAirways tells me to talk to @AmericanAir about my delayed flights. AA tells me to talk to US. #ihatemergers
@USAirways this is going to take up to an hour--not okay USAir. Not okay. This is ruining everything.
@USAirways 25+ min. Hung up. Always awful having to call Reservations there.
.@USAirways I guess from now on I should take my chances &amp; keep the $50 for the courtesy free because it seems cabin is always full.
@USAirways 4 hours Late Flightr And i lost my conection 
@USAirways over 15min hold on your reservation line. embarrassing. AA Platinum member.
@USAirways yes.  Every one of these on every flight is like this.  There needs to be more Velcro or something
@USAirways forgetting to fuel up? Realizing there was more cargo to add to plane? One way to try and mask a delay.
@USAirways Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew!
@USAirways FUK U US AIRWAYS WITH YO SHITTY CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICH THAT SO OVERPRICED AND U FUKING MAKE ME WAIT IN A 6 HR LAYOVER FUK U AND
@USAirways why are you letting us go to the runway if there are mechanical problems. #wewantcomps
@USAirways WTF is going on with the 1:30 from DC to BOS? Twice we go back back to the gate after leaving for the runway? Total BS.
@USAirways I keep missing my updated connections. Need to make it to #JAX to be in my friend's wedding! #strandedattheairport
@USAirways how are you guys losing luggage when it was suppose to be on the same flight I was on. Highly disappointed no meds no clothes :(
@USAirways @garywerk poor excuse. I was towards front of plane, no sandwiches, we have to pay for them, should have more
@USAirways I'm not patient. I'm annoyed. If you can't book this travel online, then you shouldn't make people wait on the phone.
@USAirways still in yuma waiting for 2702 to go. Looks like I might miss 2696 to MontereyRegionalAirport need options please
“@USAirways: @alan_bledsoe Thanks for your feedback, Alan.” Thx, but  no help as I watch a flt Lve w/open seats and I wait 3hrs for nxt flt
@USAirways still waiting on a response
@USAirways - who do I call to use credit fm. prev. cxl tix that can't be rebooked online?Rep I called quoted me $1k higher than the website.
@USAirways so basically I am stuck paying for hidden fees and being bumped to an inferior flight. JetBlue here I come. #usairways #mergers
@USAirways Some of my 4 kids are anxious. Husband and I can't sit with all 4 with current setup. No warning that our 6 seats changed.
@USAirways but you guys switched me and didn't inform me of the chathes
@USAirways worst airline ever....left without luggage for 7 days, submit $700 expenses and they offer a refund of $297? #badservice
@USAirways your app is bad, and you should feel bad.
@USAirways yes thanks I have never seen anything like this and I come to Yuma all the time, big disappointment. There are 40+ still waiting
@USAirways has the most ass backwards process for using credits on flights. even trying to get a hold of customer relations is impossible
@USAirways @AmericanAir Will you be destroying lives in Eastern @GastonCounty during this lively little event? For profits you will.
@USAirways 5 hour cross country morning flight and you have no food? #BadService
@USAirways we bought our tickets months ago. Had seats together for all 6. Haven't changed flight. Now 4 kids seats are scattered on plane.
@USAirways 1 person to check in 50 people and the plane boards in 20 minutes and he is telling people @AmericanAir exec bene's not honored
@USAirways Cancelled Flightled due to maintenance. The plane was there for 10 hours. Get your shit together because there are a lot of people unhappy.
@USAirways a year and every time with US Air something happens. I sat waiting for a re-scheduled flight for 10 hours then to say its
@USAirways was switched to an American Airlines flight, not by choice, and now I am charged $50 for bags? Thought y'all merged?
@USAirways No I got to Philly on Monday and got to my final destination South Carolina on Wednesday. Its not acceptable.
@USAirways over an hour now and still no one at the Yuma counter
@USAirways now you have over 50 people in line. This is stupid!!! What the heck!
@USAirways some people in line have been waiting 55 minutes for a customer service representative
@USAirways @americanair I feel sorry for AA
@USAirways there has been NO one at the Yuma ticket counter for 30 minutes and there are about 30 people in line. Terrible service!!!
@USAirways what an amazing day. Delayed 4 hrs bc frozen h2o on plane Now sitting @ gate on same plane 4 30 mins still waiting! #flight1797
@USAirways Stuck in Philadelphia airport for 32 hours due to ""maintenance"". Dreading my flight back home. Disgusting.
@USAirways thanks for telling me my flight was on time when the plane was broken. You're an inferior airline.
@USAirways I've called to resolve my dividend miles issue for a week to no avail.  Please advise ASAP.
@USAirways they finally answered. They were rude and didn't help me at all.
@USAirways I've been on hold for 36 mins and counting cause you charged my credit card for bag but provided no receipt and said error. Awful
@USAirways 1917. Still sitting here. Feels badly handled.
@USAirways Was just on hold with you all for TWO HOURS and then got hung up on. oh my god.
@USAirways. On phone hold for 30+ mins trying to speak to an agent. Can't change reservation online. Sigh. #badcustomerexperience
@USAirways I've been on a music hold for over a hour trying to get my AAdvantage membership merged, can someone please call me ASAP?
@USAirways How about moving my seats to where I bought them 4 months ago? This happens far too often...
@usairways if you could change your name to @southwestair and do what they do...that'd be awesome. Also this plane smells like onion rings.
@USAirways got rebooked. Sent to A9. Wrong gate! Traveled back to B13 for correct flight. #tired&amp;frustrated
@USAirways any updates on flight 1917 from Philly to LA?  Been sitting at gate for close to 2 hours
@USAirways will these prices be honored? Ive waited this 1 1/2 hours on hold to make sure I can still get the prices I originally started
@USAirways what's happening with 1217 Phl to LAX? Now 3 hr delay. Poor communication!
@USAirways  will be stuck in PHX overnight.  Service is getting worse.  Flying southwest from now on.
@USAirways left us. had to stay on other flight until they got bags off. This sucks. Had to run with a baby and bags!
@USAirways . Passed frustrated 4 hours ago after being asked to get off the first plane I sat on for an hour.
@USAirways another bad experience today.  Frozen pipes on 597.  Missing connection.
@USAirways of course! ""Yeah, travel has gotten harder. Ask other passengers if they will switch"" it's not the fact, it's the attitude!
@USAirways never imagined it would be so hard to SPEND money through US Air. Stubbornly hoping someone will come back to the phone.
@USAirways found great prices thru US Air for honeymoon. Website wont work and been on hold for more than a hour now after being told 10 min
@USAirways we on on the flight from phf to clt. At the terminal but can't get off plane yet. Need to get on iah flight.
@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm a chairman who was in 1st class on both my flights today. System Cancelled Flightled my tickets and kicked me out of 1st.
@USAirways I've been on hold for 40 minutes just to get a receipt. I know you guys are busy but I think it's time to higher more staff!
@USAirways yeah , I have been expecting The same for 3 hours
i wish i was flying @USAirways ... @JetBlue Cancelled Flightled our flights tomorrow and never notified us #FlyUS #Ripoff
@USAirways that's it?!?!?
@USAirways they had to turn the seat cushions over and clean the area. Please explain this issue?
@USAirways My booked seat ended up being the last row which was labeled ""do no occupy"" had to play musical chairs for 30 mins. Unacceptable
@USAirways @HirasmusBidragi will try.. Now stuck on tarmac waiting on gate. :( may miss 9:25 connection #883)
@USAirways I thought about moving a lot of business over too, but first impressions count.. Glad it was miles and not cash.
@USAirways on flight # 556 delayed#connection help for flight # 561 # help via email
@usairways hey just letting you know you're the worst fucking service I've ever used thanks for nothing
@USAirways [Part 2 of 2] she tried calling cust serv and the system hung up and her. Twice. Are you having system issues? Please advise.
@USAirways my wife is trying to check in for a flight tonight out of RSW...website not allowing, saying must go to airport... [Part 1 of 2]

@USAirways plz plz plz hold 4438 to EYW. The 810 PHL &gt;CLT is sooo Late Flight. Gonna miss the connection for @jabevan221 's 40th #GTH239
@USAirways i hate you
@USAirways understood and so does us airways.  Getting through tsa is the problem
@USAirways so I was just told I was coded as an upgrade... I clearly purchased this seat with my miles and refuse to downgrade. #ripoff
@USAirways the gate agent said ""it's booked in full. Sorry"" I had a ticket with a 1st class seat. I will call customer service when I land.
@USAirways Empty 1st class, Chairman can't move up due 2 silly award travel rule trumping common sense - customer service fail again!
@USAirways you're the only airline that's not open sooner. It's not a confidence booster.
@USAirways checked in last night @ airport by supervisor w boarding pass for 1A - boarding today seat changed to 7F. How does that happen?
@USAirways new problem...had wrong last name on reservation which is airways fixed. New can't get through TSA
@USAirways this has been the worst trip with little to no customer service
@USAirways testing my patience this evening (or shall I say morning?). We waited an hour at the gate for you to find a gate agent.  130am
@USAirways flying from Manchester international to Philadelphia and getting emails about delays, no information about connecting flights..
@USAirways no. Other than being on my credit card statement, I have not received anything from you and so I have no way to look it up myself
@USAirways I waited on hold for too long. I shouldn't have to wait on hold forever when I never received a confirm. in the 1st place #help
@USAirways Been dealing w/ @americanair to solve the probs your team created. Your Manch, NH staff is clearly your C-team, btw. #NotEvenJV
@USAirways Unfortunately I doubt that the consistently subpar service will improve with the @AmericanAir merger. #USAirways
@USAirways I didn't Cancelled Flight my flight, you did. Than you loved me to another flight and forgot my bags
@USAirways : i was told my ticket expired but  i never recvd any notice  before it expired .This sucks.i paid 40k miles &amp; $125 for the tckt
@USAirways worst customer service. Still not providing me an answer even after I drove back to CLT airport. been rude &amp; unacceptable #fail
@USAirways I have run out of patience.. We are sitting in a bus without air in front of plane and there is no communication from anyone40min
@USAirways 3 delays 2 Cancelled Flightlations a double layover and 72 hours Late Flightr....could I at least get extra dividend miles?
@USAirways I didn't take my original flight. I was suppose to arrive last night than by 2:00pm today. Didn't get in til 5
@USAirways sitting for 30 minutes on the runway at dca, because your gates are full? Early landing, Late Flight flight.
@USAirways #flight4592 LET US OFF THIS PLANE!!!  please go to a gate.  This is absurd.
@USAirways @AmericanAir 2 trips in a row with missing luggage. Just like last time. I pay for baggage to be transported.
@USAirways lost our luggage. #yay
@USAirways really frustrating to be endlessly waiting at PHL for a ground crew to taxi us in at 10pm at night. Why is this taking so long?!
@USAirways : its just a very bad customer service experience// can you help
@USAirways : i have been trying to reach dividend miles  to extend my ticket for last 3 days , 20 + calls and i get a message to call back
@USAirways how does an airline misplace an airline attendant?!! been at Reagan airport since 1pm10:15 to Cincy is delayed trying to find her
@USAirways My flight finally arrived in Charlotte.  They booked my luggage thru to lga but no room on flight for me.  What a mess
@USAirways been on hold for over an hour, still don't know where my bags are, won't refund me my flight?!?! It wasn't weather!!
@USAirways no your not!
@USAirways My wife had flight changes due to weather now she cant checkin to her return flight and it fails Is it possible usair Cancelled Flightled
@USAirways yup 1:34 minutes was my limit of waiting on hold so thanks for nothing
@USAirways this is more than having patience. This is not acceptable. http://t.co/N7pSuEJDC8
@USAirways can you explain why I am on hold over an hour .Other than I'm dumb and should be using a different airline #wth
@USAirways you used to have an evening flight DCA-DSM and an early AM return. Now it's middle of the work day for both. Inconvenient.
@USAirways delays to the max
@USAirways well this is #nofun #nocustomerservice #onhold trying to make #reservations #nothappy http://t.co/m7MMq2f5FA
@USAirways it shouldn't take longer to get to the gate than the flight itself takes.... 59 minutes flying time - 47 minutes on runway so far
@USAirways attempting ckin for flight on 2/19 all day, site unable to retrieve details.  Called twice and disconnected.
@USAirways Emailed them a week ago and still nothing...
@USAirways yeah you guys just told me to call the website that I booked from. I booked on your website. UNACCEPTABLE
@USAirways still waiting! Captain reports he's called 6 times to get ground crew....and still sitting on runway. #evenLate Flightr
@USAirways you have most likely lost my business. Terrible experience! Too many times stuck on Tarmac and last min Cancelled Flightled flights. #Done
@USAirways I have been doing that all day. Can't find my bag anywhere bc they're saying it was never scanned &amp; technically never left LAX.
@USAirways why no ground crew at DCA when we're already Late Flight arriving #evenLate Flightr
@USAirways being told 'tough break and this is how it is' is unacceptable. You can't even tell me when my bags will be here
@USAirways now telling me I don't have the correct tag for my luggage!!! My luggage apparently is not in LA or Charlotte. This is not ok!!
@USAirways Your software is broken. ""Call Customer Support"" is not the fix. Like I said earlier, yell at your developers.
@USAirways It's not double booked. I spoke with CS and we've got a plan to fix this. It's still an amateur mistake that should never happen.
@USAirways @AmericanAir hey guys, due to some horrible customer service issues is there any way I can get a checked bag credit?
@USAirways delayed 2 days for weather and on top I got yelled at for being Late Flight when I was not notified of the time change #WellDone
@USAirways Not a great experience for my first time flying US Airways. Going forward I'll probably be taking my business elsewhere.
@USAirways ...Loosing a lot of business by using Barclays. I cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in Iowa.
@USAirways so far I've gotten six different answers
@USAirways Oh certainly. And now I have two $275 pending transactions on my bank account. Really happy that I was charged double.
@USAirways what's going on? I've been hearing a not-friendly 'Please wait' on repeat while I'm on hold, being transferred to idk where...
@USAirways The captain turned off the seat belt sign so people can get up and walk around.  That's not good.
@USAirways I'm sorry as well. It's been 24 hrs without my bag and I can't get a straight answers. I'm on call #6 for today.
@USAirways Ya'll need to work on your online checkout system. Two bank transactions for one ticket is bush league. Yell at your devs.
@USAirways I wish we were on our way. Now there's a problem w/de-icing.Three &amp; 1/2 hour delay so far &amp; sill not sure if we'll be taking off.
@USAirways if you could have ran your USExpress/PSA worth a damn I wouldn't be stuck in horrible CLT now.
@USAirways you run a piece of shit airline!!  Thanks for ruining AA
@USAirways Secondary screenings, a piece of the plane missing... Anything you want to tell us?
@USAirways  sitting on Tarmac in #PIT for 30 min. No announcement. Just sitting.
@USAirways I appreciate that you actually monitor Twitter, so please  pass along my feedback. I've tried calling about 15 times in 4 days :(
@USAirways Cant help but be frustrated after an hour call with u ends up with a disconnection and no answers especially as div pref member.
@USAirways I don't think I've ever had a us airways flight that went smoothly.
@USAirways PLEASE improve your phone system! Going through multiple prompts &amp; menus just to be told to call back Late Flightr = MAJOR FAIL
@USAirways once again your service leaves a lot to be desired. Flight 5141 here early, but short staffing means we wait on Tarmac...Thanks
@USAirways the Late Flightr flight to Charleston is leaving before the flight scheduled earlier.  That's so wrong
@USAirways. I'm delayed in Cha, will miss my connection in Charlotte for lga.  Not good
@USAirways we did. It added about seven hours to our day... So far... Want to take odds on our bags being on the carousel in KC? #notcool
@USAirways @MarciaVeronicaa she missed her uncle's funeral, and you ""hope"" they can find another flight. That's very considerate of you.
@USAirways My last flight was Cancelled Flightled and I'm very disappointed.
@USAirways just lost a faithful customer.
@USAirways  I have 3 times and no one has been able to help me out
@usairways. Seriously, attendants go AWOL for 60 mins.   Now flight further delayed.   Don't lite a match either http://t.co/mT8sPlm02v
@USAirways Joined Silver Preferred because I heard customer service was so great, pity I was misguided.
@USAirways it is just bad practice and I am disappointed that your airline was not prepared...honestly the last time I fly with you guys
@USAirways well this is about as worthless as your regular service.  A bunch of do nothings and idiots. #sucks
@USAirways after 3 Cancelled Flightlations and a delay, causing me to miss connecting flight. Another night not being home. Thanks #pathetic
@USAirways your app sucks balls compared to @AmericanAir
@USAirways #USAirways So my flight was Late Flight getting into charlotte so i miss my connector to Phoenix thanks again last time I EVER FLY USAIR
@USAirways ""admirals club"" at CLT has rude, and ignorant front desk staff...@AmericanAir you have fallen so far...THANKS DOUG PARKER!!!
@USAirways to CLT from JFK nasty planes, dirty seats &amp; floors, rude flight attendants- hopefully AA can get you cleaned up #disgusting #vile
@USAirways I paid for my ticket on @PayPal on the 13th and it still says pending. Is that normal? I just want the money out of my account.
@USAirways this made me have to Cancelled Flight my car reservation and it came out to more money...why did you reschedule a time without the crew?
@USAirways my flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday and moved to today, then while at my stop in DC my flight is delayed due to lack of crew US4485
@USAirways no they dont.  I think I already said that.  No one responds.  Its an auto response.  Wait is this an auto response??????
@USAirways started trying to reach a real person over an hour ago still no luck
@USAirways I tried to call your customer service line only to be kept in a que for over 45 mins...... please hold =we don't care
@USAirways you see now that is a lie.  They auto respond with insulting email. #sucks
@USAirways @FAANews how can I be stuck on a plane due to snow in Boston when it's not actually snowing in Boston?  Usair flight 2218 #US2218
@USAirways I've been waiting for desk for 45 and on hold 36min and counting...photo of desk agent on phone not flattering.
@USAirways You have Cancelled Flighted our flights 5 times over the past 3 days...and the experience has been the worst...never again...
@USAirways I realize the weather but day after day our flights keep getting Cancelled Flighted. Please prioritize ur passengers and help them
@USAirways how does that help me when I get no response from there??? #usairwayssucks
@USAirways @DRVRugby  team is back home but luggage all wet and partly damaged - Not happy! #blizzard
@USAirways stop Cancelled Flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers. #strandedinnashville
@USAirways strikes again...lost bags. And two of them. #theworst
@USAirways had 2 Cancelled Flight my trip to LA bc weather @SouthwestAir was easy but US air is making me pay $200 to use the credit. Never again
@USAirways What's the point of a baggage claim ticket if they don't scan it  for tracking?
@USAirways No access to Dividend Miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back Late Flightr. #FRUSTRATED #LivePersonPlease
@USAirways you can't even track my bag to see where it is. It's like it's disappeared.
@USAirways Can't get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles. It's been over a month since travel &amp; I've submitted twice online
@USAirways I been sitting on this plane for 40 minutes, and they are saying another 15 minutes something about paper work. This sucks !!
@USAirways is there gonna be a better day to call? I've called on 3 separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person.
@USAirways I asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service
@USAirways only to come home a day Late Flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage
@USAirways Doubt it. Gate 35x is a cluster, and every agent encounter I saw (including one with me) was outright rude. Just very put off.
@USAirways the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do?
@USAirways so mad I can't even believe  you guys Cancelled Flight my connecting flight after I leave the first stop, &amp; give me a useless hotel voucher
@USAirways Priorities should have been made. Considering a pending snow storm, why delay a flight for an hour &amp; a half? I'd like an answer.
@USAirways I've done everything. Still no luck in finding my bag. I don't understand how my bag could have been misplaced. Very upsetting.
@USAirways that wasn’t my Q but thanks. Wondering why you’re the only ones. I disguised yours to not call you out. ;) http://t.co/uH6UwuOSC0
@USAirways turns into @AmericanAir with such difficulty to past loyal customer. As a AA platinum flyer usair couldn't be more unhelpful. Why
Yes but I will nvr fly w/ @USAirways I missed my con flight bc of a coffeemaker on FT1892 Couldn't see my father be4 they put him in a coma
@USAirways 40 minutes to put my TSA number in… 40 mins… and stop holding people hostage with requiring a dividends miles acct. @tsa
@USAirways so I would have to go though the entire process again just to get you people on the phone???????? #usairwayssucks
@USAirways really, so what does that mean??? #usairwayssucks
@USAirways nope, done. Was supposed to get home at 9pm and didn't get home until midnight. #NeverAgain
@USAirways the only way to assist, is to actually answer the phone.
@USAirways would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold?
@usairways would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation?
@usairways would it kill you to not let 3,000 miles expire
@usairways would it kill you to let me know how many minutes I might be on hold?
@USAirways a $100 @Samsonite - totaled. Not happy. Not at all.
@USAirways I have sent letter after letter and get back nothing but form letters and half baked reply's #usairwaysssuck
@USAirways the least comforting thing from your pilot after sitting on a stationary plane for 3 hours is ""I don't really know what happened""
@USAirways my number is 214-725-1966.  CANT WAIT...LOL #usairsucks
@USAirways Have him call me.  I cant wait to see if anything happens.  Your service really sucks.#usairwayssucks
@scm1133 @USAirways we hate delays!! have you tried any of these?! http://t.co/7STktJXAN1 (although we're not sure what a timbit is...)
@USAirways Big fail on not having curbside baggage in Pittsburgh and you charge 30 dollars a bag!!
@USAirways that's ok, just know that I'll most likely never book with you again
@USAirways I followed you complaint procedure only to get a run around.  Your service SUCKS #usairwayssuck
@USAirways I don't mind waiting, I mind waiting on a plane, when I shouldn't have had to.  The airport has more room and you know.. food!
@USAirways why would you board ppl on a plane b4 its their turn to de-ice? Why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process?
@USAirways I tried that before using Twitter. Also gave me no helpful information. Thank you anyway
@usairways I am sure you are sincere in your apology, its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers #options
@USAirways Yeah I know that...but now I'll have to spend almost 500 dollars more on my ticket since the price has gone up over the week
@USAirways yeah either by refunding my money or 2 free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through.
@USAirways 
Are you an incompetent airline every day, or just days that end in 'y'?
@USAirways not patient - originally 11:51 and now 4:41.
@USAirways they said because there was no meal on my flight they would not - what airline serves food anymore? Update in policy?
@USAirways that link is broken. But if it's the online baggage locator, I already tried it and it gave me no useful information.
@USAirways Spoke on the phone 3 or 4 times, but no resolution. I'm still waiting to get my money back but now prices are jacked up
@USAirways stranded in Philly- #Starving and can't get a meal voucher even though your plane had mechanical issue /  next flight in 10 hrs
@USAirways On hold for an hour...connected to the wrong department by your automated system...transferred and now another 45 min &amp; counting
@USAirways link doesn't work and I've tried tracking my bag several times. Still doesn't clarify where it is.
@USAirways Would you guys please send service agents to gate B15 in Philly?  All the people missed there connections and there's only 2.
Spend 1 HOUR on hold with @USAirways .
@USAirways why would a flight arrive Late Flight or leave when 60% of your passengers have  a connection?
@USAirways  last 2 times I checked a bags they were severally damaged.   No one answers the baggage call line for status?  #chairmanlove
@USAirways this is crazy. Haven't spoken to a human yet. There has to be a better way. http://t.co/mEOAlCIPdD
@USAirways you got me home 30 hours after you were supposed to... I was living in an airport, you offered no monetary assistance!
@USAirways I've been trying for DAYS!  And I don't get hung up on until after I get through all the prompts.  What am I to do??
@USAirways Why not have an option for a call back? I'm just sitting here burning through my minutes waiting for an error to be fixed.
@USAirways 2 days and 2 hours on hold the other day. Charge me double for flights and can't even fix it. Worst service I've ever had
@USAirways I've been trying to call you for days and every time the system is overloaded and disconnects. Really?  A global company?  Help!
@USAirways Also, we are in family crisis &amp; you charge full price for all these flights, PLUS $200 2 change flights, even for emergencies.
@USAirways Thank you. But it is sad that she couldn't talk 2 a REAL person &amp; kept getting disconnected by an automated msg.
@USAirways flight today showing on time online, not able to check in. Called &amp; told was Cancelled Flightled, put on hold over an hr ago. Help?
@USAirways 2 days in a row I call and still can't get anyone on the phone. Do you actually have any employees?
@USAirways Does your company see passengers as customers or just $$$?
@USAirways flight is delayed 5 hours. No reason given. Sure love flying with your airline. #whatajoke
@USAirways My flight was delayed and rerouted, and not so much as a ""sorry for your inconvenience"" from the check-in agent? #notimpressed
@USAirways @AmericanAir 90 min delay thanks to ""maintenance issues"". Thanks for wasting a day.
Not one to complain much but really 1 hour 15minutes and still nothing. Agents or Agent ⤵ http://t.co/Q5SB0DaVuy
@USAirways thanks for crappy hotel with no food and a taxi bill followed by being on standby for your Cancelled Flightlation. #USAirways
@USAirways Hey! I booked a flight (Isabelle Gramp, Boston to LAX), and it said that it charged my credit card but the transaction didn't go
@USAirways I've been on hold with your Divident Miles service desk for 45 minutes, and that's after being hung up on the first time.
@USAirways is useless airways. Day 2 trying to get home on standby as a result of their Cancelled Flightlation. #USAirways
This is how vacations get Cancelled Flightled been on hold ⤵for 40+ minutes still havent talked to anyone. #failure http://t.co/ef4P0HISHb
@USAirways will never travel with you again. This is insanity. storms are inevitable but making us hold to just add a lap child #badservice
@USAirways any word on flight 1748 getting out of DFW in the near future? Stuck on plane at gate for over an hour
@USAirways little help to us! My husband has been on hold for an hour for something that take 5 minutes to complete.
@USAirways we might need a plane to get somewhere but just remember that you aren't the only choice #makeovertime#customerserviceplease
@USAirways still can't get through and travel in 2 days. #ridiculous #donthavehighhopes
@USAirways so the seat next to me (19B) on flight 1943 to Seattle has a tray table that is falling off... http://t.co/HAJ5lKqjW4
,@USAirways 2nd time this occurred in 3 weeks. I'm not patient. I have no choice.  #Antitrust issue
@USAirways my vacation budget was blown bc of the lack of communication from USAirways. I will never use them again or refer anyone!
@USAirways Credit to my bank account for the two days of work that I've missed because of these Cancelled Flightlations.
@USAirways No reFlight Booking Problems necessary. I can't afford to deal this kind of unprofessionalism again. I would, however, like some type of credit.
@USAirways we're all standing here and no one is saying anything. I'll most likely be missing my flight to BWI AGAIN. http://t.co/JhaU4K48yv
@USAirways that is the most useless tweet I've ever seen out of you.
@USAirways this is got to be the worst service I've ever seen with an airline. 3 Cancelled Flightled flights. Rude employees. Currently flight delayed
@USAirways so you're going to make me wait that long on the phone line when you can help me? # that's part of the problem
@USAirways now over 2 hrs. Can't wait anymore. 2 hrs for nothing. Now what?? #frustrated #USAirways http://t.co/BuwjTVUWKM
@usairways I've called for 3 days and can't get thru. is there some secret method i can use that doesn't result in you hanging up on me?
@USAirways why aren't twitter and reservations connected? What do people want? Reservations, duh?!?!
@usairways #usairways #unacceptable #holdtime REALLY?! http://t.co/UPp41AbxrQ
@USAirways @BohnJai they lost my bag @PHL baggage handlers broke open my bag and stole my camera
@USAirways grades for this trip:
Flight timeliness: ✈️
Cancelled Flightations: 
Customer Service: 
Flight attendants: 
@USAirways Has the most useless &amp; Rude employees ever at Philadelphia airport never again will I fly with them ! 
@USAirways @SDFAirport  I really needed to be back home yesterday and at work at 9am today. Been on plane and sitting for an hour #peeved
@USAirways 5534. That's the flight I was placed on after original flight to Charlotte was Cancelled Flightled.  Now 5534 is on 1hr delay
@USAirways, 1st a reaccommodation, now a delayed flight for this one.  &amp; the Gate Agent still hasn't mumbled a word. Folks getting anxious.
@USAirways  please don't go to the check in process @AmericanAir uses at #MCO. It's an absolute disaster.
@USAirways how about a phone # to talk to a real person?
@USAirways over 4 weeks since you took our money and left us stranded 9 hours from home. Had to rent a car and you still have not helped us
@USAirways I gave up http://t.co/2eDgc6TbLs
@USAirways I've been on hold for one hour and four minutes for your reservations line. How can you possibly do business this way?
@USAirways lack of communication with other offices, the customer, &amp; yall never update ur systems. U guys are 2 established 4 this mess
@USAirways u guys get too much $$$ and too many customers  to be fucking up as badly as u do
@USAirways after last night in Charlotte NC I'm seriously debating never flying you again. 50 minute on the Tarmac, connection leaves.
@USAirways why didn't you reroute BOS to JAX via DCA through CLT instead forcing an overnight @DCA #passengersLose
@USAirways I appreciate the hard work. Still, I gave up after &gt;hour. @dsearls
@USAirways my luggage was delayed. I'm looking for compensation, since, you know, you charged me for it then forgot it...
@USAirways @AmericanAir stranded in cold Texas and getting sick because you overbooked the flight and gave my seat away. #gooutofbusiness
@USAirways Worst experience ever. Unable 2 help over phone and told at last min cabin crew unavailable for flight. Never again #USAirways
@USAirways 325 minute delay - this is absurd. Feel free to provide credits... http://t.co/e09keJ9bv1
@USAirways Fuck you
@USAirways not even on your dime and free tickets.  #worsttraveldayever
@USAirways disappointment? Making own arrangements for me &amp; my sleeping toddler with zero assistance from USAir is maddening.
@USAirways thanks. We did see an agent. Unhelpful. Some got vouchers others did not for unexplained reasons.
@USAirways 25 mins after the scheduled departure and still sitting in terminal. Communication would be lovely... http://t.co/pkAxUNYfn2
@USAirways this day has been a disaster, rude employees, no help &amp; now no hotel. not flying with you again &amp; I fly ALOT! Dallas=raise=now!
@usairways missed flight connection due to flight attendant delay. Yet no voucher on your part? #fail
@USAirways of course never again tho . Thanks for tweetin ur concern but not Doin anythin to fix what happened. I'll choose wiser next time
@USAirways Already filed a report personally at the airport, however they have no idea where it is even with a tracking number.
@USAirways already called, no other options, flight is being reimbursed. Never again, you are unreliable for business travelers.
@USAirways that link leads to a website that won't open on a cell phone.  Good job, shocking that your airline is folding.
@USAirways My flight (US558) got Cancelled Flightled on 2/16 due to lack of flight crew.I was told that I'd be reimbursed for hotel. Who do I contact?
@USAirways ~45 minutes means no public transit home and an expensive cab. Promises doesn't make up for it
@USAirways my sister was supposed to leave at 10 am to go back to AL. She's only getting to NC now. Are you kidding me #NeverflyUSairways 
@USAirways 5 hr flight delay and a delay when we land . Is that even real life ? Get me off this plane , I wanna go home  (3 heel clicks)
@USAirways flt 4439 is on the ground, but you don't have a gate for us at dca. Why is this happening?
@USAirways I'm sick of living in an airport!! #getittogether
@USAirways Now, the JFK Baggage Office has actually run out of paper hotel vouchers. #thislinehasntmovedforanhour
@USAirways  really u gave 6 scotch on the rocks to an out of control drunk and would not let my sister change seats when he was grouping her
@USAirways Only the JFK baggage office is open to help re-book all of us on Cancelled Flightled flight 3121 to DCA. Shameful.
@USAirways hey let flight 1874get to the gate  hours Late Flight and no fate with dozens of kids on board
@USAirways a flight update doesn't help when we are waiting 20+ min at our arrival waiting for a plane to leave our gate. Who can I write?
@USAirways NOT GOOD. been on hold for 1hour (2x/day) since sun. to book 1-way flt dividend miles. agents send me to on hold hell. #furious
@USAirways I'm sure you don't but question still remains why we only found out at 8.20 that crew won't come before 9.50 for 8.10 flt. Tks.
@USAirways how about an update? 2hrs delayed, this obviously isnt up 2 date, havent boarded http://t.co/L7lWjaZiOA
@USAirways @noltnancy What will be is a what may be...what is...sucks. #fail
@USAirways Your whole handling of this was a joke.Boston Logan had one little old lady,ONE handling all the customers http://t.co/DH2rfUIJYP
@USAirways on hold for 1:23. All because they won't let me use a companion voucher online http://t.co/DPhQRgkdoA
@USAirways and no one has been at all helpful. I will never fly this airline again. #NeverAgain #spreadtheword
@USAirways No, they won't because after 5 hours of holding I had to give up because I couldn't borrow the phone any longer. 5 hours...
@USAirways I've been sitting in the Charlotte airport for 4 hours. Waited for crew and now maintenance.  #NeverAgain
@USAirways delayed my flight 3 times before Cancelled Flighting it, had angry and rude workers, and are now providing no helpful service at all
@USAirways My daughter is stranded in charlotte because US Airways Cancelled Flightled her flight tonight.  Completely dissatisfied with @USAirways
@USAirways Commitment to excellence is 2b praised. Can get you to the wrong city 2 days Late Flight or the right one 3 days Late Flight. #customerservice
@USAirways I'm amazed at the lack of communication with the passengers.
@USAirways when I told csr I would close acct, he couldn't care less
@USAirways stuck in Charlotte being treated like a nobody by staff.
@USAirways flights keep getting delayed and Cancelled Flighted with no information, worst customer service ever.
@USAirways what does ""your reservation is 'out of sync.'"" mean? On hold w customer service 12 min and want an idea what is up
@USAirways sits on a throne of lies
@USAirways where's my bag?  You called at noon promising it today, would like an update like your website promises.  I need that bag!
@USAirways I'm on the flight, finally in the air. Not enough food to feed customers. No movie or entertainment on a 5 hr flight.
@USAirways is the worst airline I’ve ever flown on. You guys have treated me like garbage today.
@USAirways Only water on flight 763 to DCA? This is the first time I've ever seen this happen. #ExecutivePlatinumMeansNothing #IWantCoffee
@USAirways I have a voucher from a past trip that was delayed. I thought I had to talk to someone on the phone to use it. Is that not true?
@USAirways I did, but it won't help.. Can't believe you wouldn't take full fare for first class and gave away to Platinum Member.. Profits?
@USAirways 1 1/2 hours on hold to customer service without anyone answering is more than ridiculous!
@USAirways been delayed three times now finally boarded. Been waiting 20 minutes. Now being told the plan has to be completely powered down.
@USAirways 4 hours... 4 hours... FOUR HOURS.  It's like this is a joke to you.
thanks to @USAirways my trip is all screwed up. Ive had to move meetings and a dinner and im STILL not out of nyc yet
@USAirways i dont need to check status of my flight because i was ON the plane and you had a door malfunction. Get it together!!
@USAirways freaking out about the fact you are fixing the engine from Charlotte to Orlando. #longday
@USAirways I was told there is no record of my refund.  Can someone please help me. This has been a long day
@USAirways I tried speaking to multiple people at your reservations desk after 30 min on hold. #waivethefee #poorcustomerservice #Neptune
@USAirways Being put back on hold for what has now been an HOUR is completely unacceptable.
@USAirways Stop reposting same autoresponse  That was return flight home #imateacher. Couldnt get to RSW  #neptune#waivethefee #notmyfault
@USAirways contd.. They put her on 7 pm flite tonite. I think she's on now. Worst customer service ever! U need to fix it.
@USAirways My Flight Booking Problems C68LD9 just times out when I select it under Manage My Flight Booking Problems for months now. I have emailed but no response. Help?
@USAirways UR service is so shitty. Pilot never showed up so we waited hours because another pilot was supposed to come but didn't #Cancelled Flighted
@USAirways if I cant get through to reservations how can they take a look? 2+ hour hold times are not reasonable in any industry!
@USAirways 3+ hours on hold... oh, wait, for less than 5 minutes a useless CSR talked to me and put me back on hold for the last 30 minutes.
@USAirways so i ask for ice and the attendant snaps ""i dont have ice on this cart"" not 5 min Late Flightr 2 cups of ice to the people 2 rows ahead.
@USAirways I've been waiting for the callback for EIGHT HOURS. HOW MUCH LONGER?!
@USAirways 2 and a half hours on hold... Hope it feels good to be a steaming pile of shit.  @AmericanAir paid far too much for you.
@USAirways Total BS... I offered to pay for a full First Class airfare ..Told Sold out.. 3 seats and they gave the seats to others... #crap
@USAirways I been on hold with U for 40mins wasting my time and $ &amp; I don't appreciate it #WheresTheCustomerServiceAt http://t.co/phI2IfNjIT
@USAirways It was US 893. The gate was open after about 50 mins waiting. What a great way to finish an 18 hour delayed arrival!!
@USAirways flight 4524  first a 2 hour wait for a deadhead crew  then deadhead crew takes overhead bin space paying customers annoyed
@USAirways And really, it's a middle initial versus middle name. All else the same. Not spending my time on your computer issues.
@USAirways very disappointed I wasn't ""allowed"" to change seats after checking in early online for a flight tomorrow morning.
@USAirways They're all reservations numbers and none are in Hungary. And my phone not working here. You make it too difficult.
@USAirways 8 weeks to refund this ticket - 0372389047497?!? - totally unacceptable.  Fix this or I'll put it on blast on social media and TV
@USAirways yes I can pay out of pocket that us not helping me for loosing my first class ticket to coach.   I want resolution or a comp
@USAirways @AmericanAir Your staff members are looking at me like I have two heads. Check your own websites!!! http://t.co/8Hh0c63TIe
@USAirways flight 4524 delayed for 2 hours for a deadhead crew.  Lets make 150 paying customers wait ...that is great service #USAirways
@USAirways is anyone working today?? Anyone want to pick up a phone?
@USAirways I've been on hold for over 90 minutes... There's a lack of quality service here.  Nobody cares that I hate your shitty airline.
@USAirways stranded @Ernie_Vigil Phoenix w/ broken foot.  Both my flights f'd, Sunday for ""sickcrew"".  Cancelled Flighted my mechanics flight today.
@USAirways It's the rude and arrogant gate personnel. Uncalled for. Unprofessional. #theworst
@USAirways wont waive fees for flight Cancelled Flightlation due to #neptune To use credit, $200 fee. Couldnt reach destination @BostonBBB #notmyfault
@USAirways Feeling helpless at Tanpa airport. How can I talk to someone. Flight delayed 4 times. Need help. Missed connections will be prob
@USAirways won't waive $200 fee due to #neptune. Can't use credit w/o paying fee. Couldnt get to destination to use their tic #waivethefee
@USAirways no wonder you are the lowest rated airline in america. #shameful #USAirways
@USAirways how are you even still in business? i have been trying to call for hours. this is pathetic.
@USAirways wow this airline is a joke, absolutely horrendous customer service. you guys should be ashamed.
@USAirways Flight Cancelled Flighted because of #Neptune Could not get to my destination. #notmyfault  #waive$200fee #ripoff #poorcustomerservice
@USAirways  If you can waive a fee at time of Cancelled Flightation, you CAN WAIVE IT AT A FUTURE DATE! #usairways #ripoff #poorcustomerservice
@USAirways flight #654 sitting at JFK with delays for 3-1/2 hrs! No employees to load bags? #terrible
@USAirways I have been rebooked but It has been handled very unprofessionally. Cancelled Flightations happen but the disorganization is uncalled for.
@USAirways I have now called 12 times in the last three days. That's unacceptable. I'm willing to wait on hold, but that's not an option.
@USAirways I've been on hold for over 2 hours. Need to re-book a flight, please help.
@usairways It was 9º, and some of us had left coats in our luggage in anticipation of cramped overhead bins :|
@USAirways I'm traveling around the world until the end of the year. 800 numbers do me no good.
@USAirways can I get free wifi since the flight 1808 was Cancelled Flightled?
@USAirways was rebooked but sucked big time. Crappy layover. Customer service very sub-par.
@USAirways have done that. Sadly no flight from CLT has gotten to IND today and we head back to Tampa tmrw.
@USAirways holding 30+ min and listening to your shitty ads on repeat for your credit make me hate your airline even more.  @delta is better
@USAirways I would be on my way but   wether has delayed yet again.. Love the Charlotte ice storm!!  Good luck with mad customers
@USAirways Please staff your flights approproately. Our entire flight is delayed because FA isnt here. I shouldnt have left Delta...
@USAirways tooooo many Cancelled Flightations! My chain of command hates me now
@USAirways  you Cancelled Flightled both my flights and refused to give a voucher despite no flights for 2days. @USAirways #neveragain
@usairways I’m cool with weather delays etc. But lying and deceiving passengers to keep them from changing is reprehensible. #yousuck
@usairways I just want to get home before Wednesday... Joke is over, 50hrs of Cancelled Flightlations and delays is enough!
@USAirways The airline is embarrassing itself. I get that bad weather isn't your fault, but your response to it couldn't have been worse.
@usairways Yes. Works in Firefox. 
Can do everything but finish purchase. Button turns gray, never submits. For a couple weeks now.
@USAirways 2.5 hours Late Flightr and the flight has been Cancelled Flightled. You gotta work on your internal communication skills.
@USAirways had a horrible experience flying from Montego Bay to Philadelphia on 2/11. $125 2check a golf bag, constant selling in-flight
@usairways told no gates open at #ORD, needed to wait 20mins. Still waiting after about 4 mins.
@USAirways And it's 3:22 with no sign of boarding.... Can I please get another update?
@USAirways still can't get a real person on the phone to book a flight. Ready to just go with #jetblue since they care. #usairwayssucks
@USAirways great job communicating to the passengers! Flight 1855 doesn't exist anymore? http://t.co/hLZaHXkdSn
@USAirways @AmericanAir  we are on us/aa flight 4443.We  arrived at dca at 2:12. Waiting on our gate (33)for apx an hr now. No update?
@USAirways  Have an agent with reservations contact me instead of asking me to waste my time by sitting on the phone for hours
@USAirways If you believe in keeping your customers happy, especially after a mistake was made on your part...
@USAirways I had a rep 10 min in who said she couldn't help so transferred me to dividend miles customer service
@USAirways your customer service stinks. Trying to book a flight for hours now and keep getting hung up on. #usairwayssucks
@USAirways we've (flight 4443) been sitting on the tarmac of dca for a while now waiting on a gate. Can we just use another gate?
@USAirways I hope flight 1855 is not being delayed because flight attendant didn't come to work! #nobackup
@usairways you made us miss our flight, first class now I can't even enter the admirals club.  Not happy  dm me to fix this.
@USAirways can you please DM me, my flight has been delayed going into CLT which will force me to miss my connection to LGA at 10:05pm
@USAirways on hold for 2 hours. You know what just keep my money
@USAirways charging $200 2 change a flight is a rip off the reason I have 2 is out of my hands &amp; I want 2 reschedule same flight but in July
@USAirways flight 1808 is not leaving at 2:45 because we haven't even begun to board yet. Please update your website ASAP
@USAirways @Jack_Kairys (2/2) and another sent him to the wrong line...oh and the kiosks weren't working! #thanks
@USAirways also your employees were LESS then helpful when @Jack_Kairys was checking his bag. Two just left their desks completely (1/2)
@USAirways the phone number the gate gave me doesn't work either. What is your customer service phone number?
@USAirways @Jack_Kairys your site clearly explains we are allowed a carry on. This was allowed at PIT but not BOS. How does that make sense?
@USAirways never in my life have I dealt with such poor customer service, irresponsible staff and lack of care LGA-IAH day 2, baggage in NC?
@USAirways Thks 4 tip. Seems like a workaround rather than a customer-friendly solution. They should have an easily accessible email.
@USAirways me too. In the future, have a better harsh weather preparedness plan. So much of your staff called out that everything snowballed
@usairways If I could/wanted to call I wouldn't use the internet to make a reservation.
Site won't work on Chrome, on several computers.
@USAirways Waiting for my luggage on flight 1923. Is there a delay?
@USAirways will you please update your website with the most current flight status? And update your customer service phone # on @google thx
@USAirways you are horrendous.  Pull your shit together
@USAirways I want my money back. Now we're sitting on the runway. After a 2 hour delay, waiting for the baggage to begin loading.
@USAirways how is your gate agent gonna tell me my flight is on time when its 5 minutes past departure time and the previous flights plane..
@USAirways this is the aforementioned pilot. @AmericanAir sure you want to merge with these patron hitting hoodlums? http://t.co/C24cEfa9pl
@usairways and @AmericanAir  4 days of Cancelled Flightations, I have driven to 3 airports in 3 different states, spent more on gas than my flight.
@USAirways No speciifc email. 1500 character limit for complaints. Is AA/US customer complaints adopting the twitter model?
.@USAirways we r rebooked. got conflicting info abt baggage. Y no extra plane batteries on hand? Y no comped admirals club for 9 hr wait?
@USAirways Don't tell me that. Tell me what I can actually DO to reach someone. I don't mind being put on hold but it won't even do THAT.
@USAirways No I missed the funeral so I had to take a train back to Newark
@USAirways @AmericanAir what a joke of a company today reminded me why I never book with you
@USAirways it's be nice to take a flight and have some level of consistency / service from the flight attendants. Quality control???
@USAirways Travelling from pwm to atl on Sunday That flight got Cancelled Flightled and my new flight is Cancelled Flightled and got disconnected when reFlight Booking Problems
@USAirways I believe you. But in all seriousness, what's an acceptable time I should have this expense on my name that wasn't my fault....
@USAirways cust serv reps who are unable to change reservations in your system Check in unaware of Cancelled Flights that I got word on night before
@USAirways issues are not with people who r nice or storm emails with wrong phone numbers auto rebooked flights to non connecting cities
@USAirways missing my reservations due to a Cancelled Flightled flight. Make it right by giving me first class tomorrow. Make your customers happy.
@USAirways it's not a consolation because my bags are somewhere else, which is a real impediment to me going on a different vacation
@USAirways I booked a flight yesterday but didnt receive an email confirmation and I my dividends number isn't registering. Please help.
@USAirways &amp; there are seats together, they just have fees. Seems if I'm taking a 5am flight the least you can do is wave the $10.
@USAirways I need someone from management to contact me I was flying to a funeral won't make it now to add to my pain they want me 2 pay
@USAirways Just contaced EYEWITNESS NEWS about the ripoff the Cancelled Flighted now they want me to pay
@USAirways when I call it says y'all are too busy and to call back Late Flightr.  this is terrible customer service.  what will you do about it?
@USAirways They charged me for a flight they Cancelled Flightled, unbelievable and unheard of
@USAirways I was completely ripped of by US Airways today never fly this airline  I am contacting my local news
@USAirways I can't believe that you would refer me to a number no one seems to be getting through. Really? I need help ASAP!
@USAirways hundreds of people in line and less than half the desks being manned at CLT. Help?
@USAirways Now I am probably going to miss my connection in Charlotte, so I will have to drive home for the funeral.
@USAirways Flight 2069 from JFK to Charlotte, then 3750 from Charlotte to Birmingham. 2 previous flights to HSV were Cancelled Flightled.
@USAirways still crickets from customer service.
That is not an excuse to have such a poor website Flight Booking Problems options! My yearly vacation is about to fall through, ubetter do smth!
@USAirways The phone line disconnects. How can I be in the queue to be answered when the phone line simply disconnects when I call?
@USAirways want to bump up my seet to first class for two Cancelled Flightlations in 24hrs?? what a joke
@USAirways This is dating back to Nov. I have been sent back and forth between you and @eDreams_en. It's a disgrace.
@USAirways I didn't even leave the airport and you sent 2 of my bags to Philadelphia!
@USAirways Thanks for the info but have been trying for over 24hrs and no luck. Flight dep. Today. Need 2 change 2 tomorrow or Thursday
@USAirways tried twice today on hold for 30 min each time. i have things to do so can't live on hold dealing w/ your customer serv failures
@USAirways no warm weather hubs means no Mexico for us.  And I can't go anywhere else since you lost my bags. I hope you attempt to rectify
@USAirways No kidding. Oy.
@USAirways thank you for blowing my vacation. Couldn't get me anywhere today to make my reservation and also lost 2 bags of mine!
@USAirways been trying to talk with a dividend miles rep for 2 days now. I have been holding for over 2 hours each day. What are my options?
@USAirways your customer service is horrible
@USAirways I expect something more than telling me to see an agent to rebook my flight...
@USAirways you have the ability to switch my flight to @AmericanAir but you cannot tell me where my bags are.
@USAirways I did and it's been a disaster. You had me sitting on the runway only to bring the plane back to the gate smh
@USAirways no we haven't because we've been in the same line at the service desk for an 1hr and 1/2 now in the same spot.
@USAirways I got up at 2 am for a 5 am flight from bos to Charlotte which I found was Cancelled Flightled once I got to the gate (1)
@USAirways  well its 11:45am and just got an email that my 11am flight is delayed-thats not right
@USAirways How soon is possible? I boarded the plane the 1st time at 6:30 am and it is now after 11:30 am and I'm still where I started.
@USAirways your chairmans phone is down. what other number can i use?
@USAirways @AmericanAir you make Spirit look like the gem of air travel. You haven't handle this winter storm very well...
@USAirways it takes a month?
Yes, I filed a report in Atlanta. My bags are in Charlotte, NC. 24 hours Late Flightr and still can't find my luggage ... @USAirways
@USAirways Almost 4 hours and coin now. Understand higher call volume, but this is unacceptable.
. @USAirways It's been Cancelled Flighted. Your SM response is slow.
@USAirways I’ve had my flight Cancelled Flightled twice now, and after 5 minutes of automated questions, the phone just goes to a busy signal. Help?
@USAirways great job today In ruining 45 people's vacation. Thanks to your incompetent pilot and staff we have all now missed our flights
@USAirways your service has been awful in Boston and I had to pay 25 extra dollars than I was supposed too I am very dissatisfied #mad
@USAirways I have been on hold with your Gold reservations line for OVER 3 HOURS now. Flight Cancelled Flightled. Trying to rebook.
.@USAirways we have no choice but to pay another $50 to go to the airport in the hopes that we will be treated better by a rep.
@USAirways reservations had me on hold for 2 hours only to hang up...smh 
@USAirways @AmericanAir How r u supposed to change flights when u can't get thru to reservations? #OneHourOnHold
@AmericanAir why would I even consider continuing your point program when I received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless
@AmericanAir no thanks.  As I said, being denied miles that expired one week ago was the last drop for me; plan to avoid AA as possible.
@AmericanAir aa employees were rude and unwilling to help. 10,000 miles is a rotten cherry on top of a dog shit Sunday. #nocareforcustomers
@AmericanAir 1hr 46 min. Cost of flight change $788. Was $188 2hrs ago b/f drop call. Cancelled Flighted flight. Asked 4 refund.
@AmericanAir it's not just frustrating--it was PAID for! how do we get a refund?
@AmericanAir I sure hope you all can fix @USAirways. Good luck, their service sucks. #nexttimeiwillflysouthwest
@americanair thanks for no fresh food on my cross country flight and for making my connection so close No time to eat. TPA-DFW-LAX
@AmericanAir your planes made me miss 2 connections in 2 days. Thanks for nothing
@AmericanAir I purchased Main Cabin XT for f-1571AUS. Flight was Cancelled Flightled and I was rescheduled on 1600 with regular seats. Credit?
@AmericanAir thx for responding. I cant watch 2 mins of this film w/out it cutting in and out 4 prolonged prds of time. beyond frustrating
@AmericanAir r u serious?? 304min #delay with #AmericanAirlines #AA2444 #ohio - #dallas missed my connecting flight http://t.co/DNMsblzumr
@AmericanAir You are jumping the gun and Cancelled Flighting flights that could've made it before the snow. Now, more Cancelled Flightlations. It's ridiculous.
@AmericanAir This doesn't address my issue. I am on hold for 30 min to speak with an agent.
@AmericanAir submitted a case to AA customer relations two weeks ago, no word ever since! whats the point of even having CR?
@AmericanAir if by near the gate you mean sitting on the plane for almost 2 hours, then yeah.
@AmericanAir still waiting for a flight... I should get my money back
@AmericanAir I Cancelled Flighted my flight. I really don’t need this much trouble.
“@AmericanAir: @Andrew_Wasila We're sorry you were uncomfortable, Andrew. What can we do for you?” SMA
@AmericanAir that's 16+ extra hours of travel time. Missed vacation time and now you guys are messing with my professional life.
@AmericanAir Checked in on app since yesterday. Confirmed upgrade &amp; carry on, got to counter &amp; manager upgraded somebody else on my seat!
@AmericanAir I have been on hold w/customer service line for 68 minutes.  This after I was on phone with an agent for 35 min b/f call droped
@AmericanAir I tried to book a rwrd and was told I couldnt. Bought tix on USAir (now AA-no choice) didn't bother to + AAdv# with this svc...
@AmericanAir narrowly made standby...lots of snags this trip!
@AmericanAir i ordered it as i always do. But on a 9hour flight delayed for 4 hours, it was worse than ever before when you forgot my meal.
@AmericanAir - Please find my bag!! In Singapore for three days already without my bag. Last known destination LAX Tag: 580815 Please help.
@AmericanAir “Inconvenient” is such a convenient word.
@AmericanAir
 Your response could have made all the difference. It could have made the situation better. NO TRUST...GET LOST like my bag.
@AmericanAir delayed on the way to Puerto Rico and delayed on the way back to New York, this is disgraceful
@AmericanAir That's ok...You may keep my $25 and lose my bag with no info, but you no longer have my trust. Bad way to handle this.
@AmericanAir come on I just want to go home I can't miss another day of work #stuckinmemphis #texasisclosed
@AmericanAir you guys are killing me. http://t.co/22iPGeIcSm
@AmericanAir Its not that I wasn't offered ""perks"" by @USAirways.  I ASKED and was told, ""NO."" #thenewamerican
@AmericanAir good care of their customers if anything happen to then take you @Delta  for getting me back to NYC !! Screw you @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir cost me over 200 dollars because flight was Cancelled Flightled and couldn't even give me a food comp!! Fly @JetBlue @Delta they take
@AmericanAir they will just say dumb things to beat around the bush ! If you're flight Cancelled Flightled be prepared for no compassion from them
@AmericanAir worst company ever please do not fly with them I repeat please do not fly !! They will not credit you if you're delayed
@AmericanAir lost my cats, missed their flights, kept them crated 30 hrs for a  would-be 5 hr trip. You'll never touch my pets again.
@AmericanAir why am I continually getting put on hold by painfully inexperienced people when calling your Platinum desk?!
@AmericanAir pretty lame response to a two paged single spaced letter http://t.co/aCebo6ELPa
@AmericanAir 
It's not what happens to us that matters...It's our response that matters. Way to drop the ball AA.
@AmericanAir AND they Cancelled Flighted my flight and left me with no help to find a hotel to stay in. I slept in an airport for a night-_-
@AmericanAir my flight 386 from Jacksonville fl to Dallas is showing Cancelled Flightled. What is going on?  Am I rebooked on another flight?
@AmericanAir my flight 386 to Dallas from Jacksonville fl has been Cancelled Flightled. No one has notified me. What's going on?
@AmericanAir extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings
@AmericanAir flight 65 delayed over 4 hours on 2/22, had no GF meals despite my early request, attendant seat fell on my leg #badservice
@AmericanAir but, what I can always rely on when I fly USAir or American is that employees will be rude and unhappy.
@AmericanAir robocalls me with another Cancelled Flightation. And then when I don’t accept the change it won’t let me connect to an agent. Just wow.
@AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that?
@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff
@AmericanAir that doesn't really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification...
@AmericanAir this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system.
@AmericanAir how about some rampers at gate b40 dfw?   Waiting to be marshaled in
@AmericanAir You Cancelled Flight my flight and there’s no way to rebook on the website or app? I have to wait 35 minutes on hold? #fail cc @Delta
@AmericanAir I'm frustrated by all of the @USAirways attitude toward #ExecPlat members. #thenewamerican
@AmericanAir another day another grievance with this airline. No customer service
@AmericanAir You've misunderstood. @USAirways WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, ""NO.""
@AmericanAir car accident on my way to the airport. Missed flight from rno to dca. Trying to resched but your line has 2 hr wait
@AmericanAir so you fail again flight to rdu sitting waiting on flight attendants. your logistics are not good
@AmericanAir It is now going to be reported to the police due to the sexual assult sad that you didn't care
@AmericanAir I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I'm now out of extra meds and diapers for baby.
@AmericanAir you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency
@AmericanAir over the last year 50% of my flights have been delayed or Cancelled Flightled.  I'm done with you.
@AmericanAir FYI...call stilling getting dropped.  After an hour of continuous dialing. Attempted to Cancelled Flight online but not able to. HELP!!!
@AmericanAir how can I get you guys to respond to my tweets and DM??? Really sad feeling to be ignored.
@AmericanAir @SouljaCoy what is AA going to do to fix their utterly embarrassing customer service? You won't even answer the dang phone!
@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.
@AmericanAir I want to speak to a human being! !!  This is not an obscene request!
@AmericanAir no response to DM or email yet.  customer service?
@AmericanAir you need to work harder on the disconnect between your intention and the reality your passengers face
@AmericanAir - how long does it take to get credit to my AA account? Traveled in Jan &amp; only one leg reported. Asked for credit, no response.
@DeltaAssist now at 57 minutes waiting on Silver Elite line for someone to pick up! Help!
@AmericanAir thanks for getting back to me. But I will find other airlines in the future.
@AmericanAir why would I pay $200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that aren't even worth $200?
@AmericanAir stranded for 24 hours in MIA, Patrick casimir has been the ONLY AA staff to apologize for the great inconvenience #unreal
@AmericanAir Mold on my flight?!? US3825 #filthyplane #hopeidonotgetsick http://t.co/zIK2UoXGnW
@AmericanAir I slept in the miami airport due to mechanical issues and was given 10,000 bonus miles to try and make it right. #slapintheface
.@AmericanAir can you connect me to a person without having to wait 2+ hours on hold? I still haven't been able to resolve the problem.
@AmericanAir don't worry. I'll be sending a letter with what I expect from you for compensation. I fly twice a week w/you guys...for now
@AmericanAir spent $8 for the choppiest feed of ""Whiplash"" ever. #americanairlinesfail #iwantmymoneyback
@AmericanAir continues to win: I've never missed a flight before, but a nice little quiet gate change made it possible. Sheesh.
@AmericanAir don't worry you won't steal my money again
@AmericanAir and @iTunesMusic have put me in bad mood. I haven't been this angry since Spagnuolo coached the #Rams
@AmericanAir flight 1181 out of Vegas to DFW. Cancelled Flightled Sunday and Monday, no whammie today!
@AmericanAir can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM.  Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks!
@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
@AmericanAir any idea on what the wait time is for refunds from @USAirways? I was told a few days over the phone - but it's well past that.
@AmericanAir 4th flight rebooked to is NOT Cancelled Flighted! Woo-hoo. Going to make it to @LaGuardiaAir
@AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
@AmericanAir change fee = same price of new ticket... Not logical
@AmericanAir we have been advised to turn this issue over to the police due to the sexual assult THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THAT ON YOUR PLANE!
@AmericanAir Fuck you.
Not giving you a hard time...Just looking for basic customer service after AA lost my bag. ETA on it's return, please????????
@AmericanAir actually, online indicates the only seating available is at a premium cost..why not allow seat selection at time of purchase
@AmericanAir your definition and mine of 10 min is vastly different. I understand the need to get off the plane for maint, but be honest.
@AmericanAir Is there a way to add my AA number to an itinerary that doesn't involve sitting on hold for 1.5 hours?
@AmericanAir 1-the lavatory freezes, 2- problem with a nitrogen line 3-a low tire with the inflating equipment malfunctioning #AA2444 and...
@AmericanAir why did flight 1636 get Cancelled Flightled? Waiting for a rep to rebook, but wondering if there will be other issues getting out.
@AmericanAir  we are going to the police dept due to the sexual assult that your stewardess allowed to occur and your lack of concern
@AmericanAir I am trying to change the time of a flight I already purchased and was told I have to pay a $400 change fee. Ridiculous.
@AmericanAir if my flight gets Cancelled Flightled i should be able to reschedule to any date i want, not the next day or 2 days after
@AmericanAir since you don't care about what happens to your passengers on your planes we will now be contacting the Police Dept
@AmericanAir why are @USAirways gold forced to pay for an upgrade? Open seats in 1st and not offered to Gold/Sapphire
@AmericanAir It's been 3 weeks and no reply from customer relations yet.  Running out of time, please help.  request: 1-2888155964    thanks
@AmericanAir Any reason why my 1463 flight to Chicago is boarding and I still don't have a seat assignment? Seriously?
@AmericanAir @USAirways if this is how your merger is going to go, you fail! Huge probls w/comm on DFW storm. Cxld rtrn flts. NOT COOL!!!
@AmericanAir why does it feel like I'm being nickeled and dime to enjoy a flight with AA? I purchased a tkt but have to pay extra for a seat
@AmericanAir Flight 2559 it's been delayed every hour since 8:55 am.
@AmericanAir Can't unload flight #3322 because jetway is broken.  #steps #planB? #waiting nearly an hour
@AmericanAir I'd love to take my seat, but it appears as though someone already has.  #disappointed #upgrademe #wtf http://t.co/9Gx5mMmubb
@AmericanAir The flight was delayed 5 times. Spent almost 40min on the tarmac. I'll reconsider my future flight options.
@AmericanAir Filled out a baggage claim over the phone last night. Check the status to discover the rep confused Arkansas for Alaska 
@AmericanAir #AmericanAirlines says most bags left in Miami have been returned following mechanical glitch &gt;&gt; http://t.co/Ib8kyjBCJM
@AmericanAir really needs to get a a clue and start treating people like humans, not animals.  #americandairlinesSUCKS
@AmericanAir and it's not a inconvenience it is a disaster. It's A $500 phone bill from you that you refuse to pay
@AmericanAir stop sending me back to ""customer relations ""I have hand written a letter to them, send in a letter, called them, no help!!
@AmericanAir Is large Wichita Falls Airport not receiving any arrivals? I have called and no one answers. I been waiting for 1 day
Can you tell me what that means? I work and just need an estimated time of arrival please? I need my laptop for work. Thanks
@AmericanAir Waiting an hour now for a pilot AA3688. Is there a pilot in the house at DFW?
@AmericanAir Lots of upset people, freezing terminal, and no gate agent. Kept us waiting on plane beyond allowable time length.
@AmericanAir The pilot admitted to us that this delay is entirely because of AA incompetence and poor equip checks.
@AmericanAir How are you going to compensate all of whose days/plans have been ruined because of the AA3490 delay/pending Cancelled Flightlation?
@AmericanAir Lost and Found is like talking to a hormonal teenager who refuses to talk to you. #useless #wastedeffort #FAIL
@AmericanAir Oh that seems to have undone the seat selections in MCE. We only wanted the CX card on there to select the free seats
@AmericanAir To announce DURING BOARDING that you chose to limit catering to the point that you WILL run out shows a lack of planning, IMO.
@AmericanAir guess that's what I get for bragging on you. I fly you by choice unlike others who fly because they don't have other options JS
@AmericanAir I guess I was one of the select few that hadn't had many problems before this and all the sudden my whole trip got jacked
Yes, and it gets disconnected due to the lack of WIFI strength “@AmericanAir: @MauererPower Have you reached out to @Gogo for help, David?”
@AmericanAir the communications seems to be an issue too, no?
@AmericanAir now we are waiting on nitrogen for the struts and the airport nozzle is not calibrated so they are trying to find another???
@AmericanAir DM me and I can explain the whole story. I should have been on an earlier flight not US1937
@AmericanAir sitting on plane in Columbus, supposed to leave an hour ago. Now the mechanic can't find a tool to service the shock absorber.
@AmericanAir I picked the nonstop flight bc I had things to get to. Should’ve taken diff route or airline I suppose!
@AmericanAir but the issue is were waiting on rampers to close the door..only to waste more fuel&amp;likely to be told we need more fuel.#cycle
@AmericanAir Is there lack of communication/competition between the American and the Air by any chance?
@AmericanAir No, had already waited an hour for it and wanted to get home.
@AmericanAir 4285. Apparently we’re told, staff on the ground keep promising to come and they don’t.
@AmericanAir over 70 days  no contact from a human or apology letter. @AmericanAir is #yucki. Read all about it soon http://t.co/9R9OmzQAVI
@AmericanAir Well I'm showing I am still sitting at the gate on the plane that has not departed?
@AmericanAir My ticket was booked with AA with miles..... Sorry we sold you a ticket with a company we merged with but we can't fix it?
@AmericanAir..still here. feet are freezing b/c doors have been open. Flt time was 8:30.  We have fuel but now waiting for ""rampers"" #AA4285
@AmericanAir Just got a call from baggage dept. ""...still looking for your property"". It's went missing 1/28. PRERECORDED NO HUMAN SERVICE!!
@AmericanAir I need to go to YYZ tmr morning 8am. I switched to United already, but my bag is still off in AA la-la land.
@AmericanAir the whole plane is the same. How old is this plane?  The seats leather is coming apart ay the seams.
@AmericanAir If the flight I selected online was what was ticketed I would not be missing my connection. I need help getting to DFW or IAH!!
@AmericanAir my seat is disgusting. Old and dirty. When are you going to refurbish this plane?  US Air 597 jfk to phx
@AmericanAir I understand the need to drain the lavatory fearing freezing but why no policy on checking that before boarding? smh come on...
@AmericanAir once again flying AA4285, once again 60+ min delay because of mechanical issues. Perhaps you should consider maintenance?
@AmericanAir no repair made to the water line. No potable water on board this flight. ""We will take off soon."" Time for new planes MCI&gt;DFW.
@AmericanAir there is no local agent! There is no person to answer our questions and their phone service is terrible.
@AmericanAir As I already have a booked flight that I can't use &amp; can't change w/o a $200 fee, Flight Booking Problems a different type of ticket...1/2
@AmericanAir an overzealous stewardess prevented us from bringing in a car seat! #worstflight!
@AmericanAir watch out if you are a parent...they break stroller &amp; tell you look at the fine print
@AmericanAir ok. There is no one at the airport that is helping us. Another customer got told the flight isn't leaving till 1220
@AmericanAir how do I talk to an actual person that will help me, and do what you guys should do?
@AmericanAir Customer service provides no wiggle room to change flight without a $200 change fee. @southwest has always been accommodating.
@AmericanAir flight AA1119, cx to AA157. Killing my layover, still wanting breakfast. I'm hungry! Get me to DFW!
@AmericanAir your staff at rsw working the sliver airlines desk is not helpful. We can not get any information about our flight.
“@AmericanAir: @Dumas2TTG Good morning, Tamara. We'll try to get you comfortably on a flight as soon as we can.”#NoXTraLegRoom #NoCoatCloset
@AmericanAir how do you NOT do maintenance on #MD80 while it sits for two days? Frozen lines found after its boarded? Come on! #faail #mci
@AmericanAir That what I hoped - contacted them 3 wks ago about this but they have not responded and still issued in US funds. #frustrated
@AmericanAir @USAirways #Boo! Wack ass terminal 6 @flyLAXairport. No food. No lounge. No Bueno!! Never again!!!
@AmericanAir You sent me a cheque today which can’t be paid into a UK bank account. VERY annoying!
@AmericanAir I’m still waiting - this has been going on far too long. Is there someone I can speak to?
@AmericanAir  zoom in on the sauce and potatoes.  This stuff is vile.  And I mean vile. http://t.co/m2PHoavRxC
@AmericanAir - 6 months ago best catering out of all domestic airlines. Today. Worst on the planet. And I've flown almost all of them
@AmericanAir   What is that!? Why even bother catering dog food that no one will eat ? http://t.co/iFESPcBzTm
@AmericanAir  thanks for making the worst fly experience ever. Will never book again with your airline. Train your flight attendants better.
@AmericanAir I lost my (basket) ballbag on your plane
@AmericanAir She was at gate on time though, they made her cry, and made a scene for 10 mins instead of boarding her. Plane still outside.
@AmericanAir Disappointing lack of kindness toward this person. The agent asked her counterparts ""why this person was talking to her"".
@AmericanAir yes starting w/ flight 1278, getting me home more than 48 hours Late Flightr. record locator BSUXLU
@AmericanAir Your AA3465 staff are refusing to allow a woman to board. She was here at 8 for 8:16 departure. Sign still ""Now Boarding""...
@AmericanAir @USAirways stated before I'm not getting any help there. Tk over 8 hrs yest to spk to a live person then told to chk the site.
@AmericanAir but not sufficiently sorry to actually *do* anything about it, I guess. Your systems are presumably beyond reproach or reform.
@AmericanAir as your flight attendants are an extension of your brand - bitchy flight attendants on 5:30 am flights are not appreciated.
@AmericanAir again, no special meal catered for me in F JFK-LAX. thankfully i'm on qantas the rest of way-i fear what youd NOT cater on that
@AmericanAir @superyan I did not get any compensation after Cancelled Flighting my departure TWICE and made me missed my own wedding.
@AmericanAir 140 characters aren't enough to describe how inconsiderate your employees are
@AmericanAir your cabin 'thank you' message reminds people about having choices when they fly. I will be choosing another airline next time.
@AmericanAir really? That's it? Not even a ""we are looking into this to see what happened/what we could do better next time""
@AmericanAir Delayed: AA3186 - Missed due to delay: AA3186 - New flight now delayed: AA2401
@AmericanAir She told us we had to drive back to drop it off so they could attempt to fix it. Really? Don't have time to do that. #terrible
@AmericanAir The flight is the wrong day. Confirm # USXLON. Departure on 5/21 should be 5/22 for 2 people
@AmericanAir having trouble Flight Booking Problems a seat on US84 11 March, operated by AA. Neither airline's website will allow seat selection?
@AmericanAir thank you for the robotic and non helpful assistance.
@AmericanAir I would love to say the same but it's not so much. 5hs flight, no internet, no personal A/C, 20yr old plane. #NoFunAtAll
@AmericanAir Uwon't allow me2make changes online, force me2sit thru excess phone wait times&amp;still insist charging crazy fees. Thats service?
@AmericanAir Horrible service @loganairports. Luggage got destroyed on flight and woman at baggage service was so rude. Didn't help at all.
@AmericanAir That’s a rather clunky process. Whoever designed that clearly doesn’t understand e-mail 101.
@AmericanAir Your customer relations dept has one-way e-mail. How is not allowing responses helpful?
@AmericanAir she has  the guy u served drinks 2  til he needed awheelchair to get off the plane is a more important then the assaulted women
@AmericanAir there's a lot of talks and no doing. 
MIA-SFO on a 20+ year old plane #nonewplanes #old #shame http://t.co/TwETPXUpPN
@AmericanAir Sorry that is a sad answer a fully refundable first fare and no response in 6 weeks ! No more AA in my future !
@AmericanAir are you a bot? Haha always same lies from you!
@AmericanAir especially during a death in the family and still no solution. 96 hours and counting...Thanks
@AmericanAir so great AA1103 sitting for an hour first technical problems now what?
@AmericanAir this has to be the absolute WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!
@AmericanAir so I have to call back at 9 since the department is closed. This has to be the biggest bunch of bull!
@AmericanAir just need to know why it wasn't done like it was promised it would yesterday
@AmericanAir too Late Flight now. Boarded, exit rows taken. Could not have gotten worse. Guy next 2 me should've bought 2 seats. #miserablemorning
@AmericanAir re-staff and commence new policies because your industry is so embarrassed by you.
@AmericanAir 3 months of straight travel ahead. Time to find new airline.
@AmericanAir face palm!!! Cannot believe the last 24 hrs 1.5 hrs of sleep and No and no and what you can't do......
@AmericanAir just wow Regina just told me I can't file or request a lost bag statement until I finish my travel.  So until I get to DC argg
@AmericanAir I shared my experience several times (AA Ref#1-2990176298), but AA's response is senseless, weather was not the cause!!!
@AmericanAir You should be apologizing for your rude sales reps and failure to offer anything other than trite, condescending platitudes....
@AmericanAir is non existent and I will take this as far as needed.Why hide behind a corporate logo? Provide a number #tcf #useless #amateur
@AmericanAir LAX-OGG-LAX using hard earned miles and was given lousy service, faulty seats on both legs and damaged bag. Your customer care
@AmericanAir they were no where to be found at Midnight Last Night! I would think the agent in LAX could have relayed that info.Bag on flt
@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flight both flights yesterday and rebook me in middle seat. Not acceptable. Upgrade to emergency row would help. #nothappy
@AmericanAir is it right to provide faulty seats on flights plus damage a $350 bag and not replace and shrug the damage off? Flights from...
@AmericanAir it isn't good enough. You need to provide a phone number. Other partners do. Should be investigated by @IATA @TheFAAOnline
@AmericanAir what's the point? So I can wait for another 6 weeks. U r one of the only airlines that refuses to handle complaints by phone
@AmericanAir machines are broken, lines are out the door for self service, cust. Support, and bag check in.
@AmericanAir merged airlines do not work for FF programs. Very frustrating and the gate agents are to busy pouting to care. #AttitudeIssues
@AmericanAir when you strand someone in a city without luggage you would think AA would want to earn your business, but guess not?
@AmericanAir needs to get their shit together. 2 counter people &amp; a massive line. People need to catch their flights! http://t.co/4MQFMxeBXt
@AmericanAir  oh no she left the counter and went downstairs.  Then she told Elise an agent that joined her not to come over to counter.
@AmericanAir @Delta Maybe? Long trip, Late Flight night &amp; queues at baggage claims in two terminals, no good. I thought I paid for it 50$ instead.
@AmericanAir you really need some customer service training for your unhappy EEs in the morning in Chicago. Gate K20 at 430 chking her schd
.@AmericanAir (2/3) ...I sat on the runway for 4 MORE HRS b4 takeoff (10 hrs Late Flight, 4:30 AM). Pilot plainly stated it was a comp/mech issue.
.@AmericanAir Alright prove it: (1/3) 3 days ago, I sat on a plane at JFK for 3 hrs, deplaned for 3 more, and when I re-boarded...
@AmericanAir I'm trying to choose my seats but every time I go to the next flight I get system error
@AmericanAir leave us stranded, send baggage with important medication to different city for 4days&amp;apologise with a $50 voucher. appalling.
@AmericanAir I've been trying to change a Thursday flight and there's a ridiculous wait time on the phone, and your website isn't helping
@AmericanAir We all did! Skipper's walk-around too :(
@AmericanAir just went to check into flight 24 hr advance, again husband and I are seated separately for 6hr flight! why does this happen??
@AmericanAir no; I just expect a higher level of customer service &amp; for the flight crews to give us accurate information
@AmericanAir or at the very least an explanation on why no one told me my flight was Cancelled Flightled!
@AmericanAir I tried when I landed, but there was no-one there.  I've emailed your customer service twice now who don't seem to care.
@AmericanAir no I've since rebooked with another airline, what I would like is compensation for all the time/money lost!
@AmericanAir nothing, you have done enough.
@AmericanAir I was rebooked on a flight that was too Late Flight for my connection!
@AmericanAir gah this is so frustrating! Nobody has my address here in the USA. Where are my bags!?!? So disorganised!!!!!!!!!!!
@AmericanAir I have emailed several times.hand wrote a letter,went to airport,called.please fix this! Or @abc7newsBayArea please help!
@AmericanAir offered me a cot to sleep on?After they Cancelled Flightled my flight. A fucking cot. What about a hotel, like you're supposed to provide
@AmericanAir another generic response guys? Cmon. You're terrible. How about an actual helpful person? Not all the rude employees at LAX
@AmericanAir I tried, EXTREMELY RUDE. Even the supervisor. And when I asked to speak to HIS supervisor I was told no
@AmericanAir yes but you are still human I hope, dealing with all the horror stories people share... I complained to DOT. Everyone should
@AmericanAir try contacting everyone on that flight with a refund offer and we might believe you are sincere
@AmericanAir I have filed multiple complaints. I prefer to continue warning the public instead of wasting more time with this inhumane corp.
@AmericanAir worst experience of my life avoid at all costs they will lose your belongings and have no humanity to even offer compensation
@AmericanAir terror story my luggage was delayed both ways on an international flight for over 5 days total #angrycustomer
@AmericanAir WORST SERVICE EVER!! Delayed flights for more than 5 hours plus you missed my bag! And your employees are rude 
@AmericanAir thanks for the generic computer generated response. How about you accommodate your travelers instead of just saying sorry
@AmericanAir they are giving cots to the people that did not get hotel rooms...that is terrible..
@AmericanAir I did twice.got a letter back saying that your company ""doesn't issue refunds for phone bills"" help!phone will be shut off
@AmericanAir its not weather thats why i said the other people received hotel rooms while the people at the end of the line did not get them
@AmericanAir after losing my bags for 4 days&amp;charging me $475 to""arrange pick up""in argentina,claiming tollfree: won't reimburse me. Help!
@AmericanAir pity that a machine replied, or perhaps my story not unusual. Expected better response given article in in-flight magazine.
@AmericanAir i have been rebooked for the 7am flight. My questions is, why do some people get hotel and the others don't like myself?
@AmericanAir I responded. Your info different than your customer service line
@AmericanAir will not help us on the phone, at the gate or in checkin. I book travel for clients and cannot believe the lack of service
@AmericanAir no no no, YOU DM me, I pay you money and you want to me to reach out to you for help? How about the other way around
@AmericanAir I had a 6am flight I can get no rest because I have to wait another 2 hours to receive an automated phone call. #neveragain
@AmericanAir does not know the meaning of customer service. Nightmare. Paid for direct flight. Bumped to Dallas. Flight Cancelled Flighted. Terrible
@AmericanAir that's absolutely horrible customer service. The person supposed to call me can't immediately call back when disconnected???
@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled I called they said they'd call back in 1:36. They did And hung up now saying I have to wait 2 hrs!!
@AmericanAir what kind if airlines do you guys run? The people that got in line first received hotel vouchers? Terrible customer service!
@AmericanAir @emxlyy ""The wheel was broken when we got it. We swear.""
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled flight from fresno then rebooked for LAX now flight Cancelled Flightled again and its midnight with no more hotel available???
@AmericanAir you guys Cancelled Flightled my flight for today and booked me for tomorrow, so unfortunately i have rebooked. Thanks
@AmericanAir after running from one flight, because we had 10 mins, to our next flight, we then sat on our plane for an hour.
@AmericanAir nothing to do with Mother Nature, more like poor commutation.
@AmericanAir is the worst airline in the entire world. I only flew them because I had to and it was the nightmare I knew it would be.
Why doesn't @AmericanAir provide a means for dialogue?  What is the fear that drives this decision?  #worstcustomerserviceever
@AmericanAir 2284, four hours Late Flightrs and we are finally flying out...too bad I missed my event
@AmericanAir please allow me to speak with someone. A dialogue would solve this issue better and faster than emailing.
@AmericanAir it's not only my bag...it's the complete lack of respect when I called. I was hung up on. And it is my daughters bag
@AmericanAir  it's not cool that my flight was Cancelled Flightled after sitting on the plane for over an hour. ✈️ #notahappycustomer #leavingtomm
@AmericanAir no, you should do something about everything happened yesterday...
@AmericanAir Thanks! Bleh, disconnected! Let's try this again!!
@AmericanAir  your customer service is deplorable. I am disgusted in your company and the ignorant people on the phones for lost baggage.
@AmericanAir were stuck on a plane in Dallas that's supposed to be going to Okc. There's an issue w/ the plane. Any idea on how much longer?
@AmericanAir they responded. I can't respond to their response. Nor can I speak with someone. #worstcustomerserviceever
@AmericanAir gate agents disappeared and customer service agents were miserable and unhelpful. #letdown #neveragain
@AmericanAir Who do I report missing baggage to when baggage claim leaves before midnight?
.@AmericanAir how about connecting me with a customer service rep? I'd rather speak to a person than a computer. Thanks!
@AmericanAir TSA. When I tried to check in the things I've bought your people told me it was Late Flight to do it. So... I want my things back
@AmericanAir couldn't get anyone on the phone all day, the flight you rebooked had me missing a conference.We won't be on flt 1568 tomorrow.
@djevolutionhd As an EP who travels 125K+ miles a yr with @AmericanAir , I would expect more from them than this horrible travel experience
@AmericanAir that was the worst customer service experience ever. Too bad for you I'm a lawyer. Enjoy my wrath.
@AmericanAir - you broke my sick wife's luggage handle going from JFK to LAX...she had to drag her bag thru the airport! #customerservice
@AmericanAir when should i expect a response from customer relations
@AmericanAir glad that you WANTED to help me, but you didn't. Have an agent call me before I rant about shitty service every day
@AmericanAir There are only 24 hours to Cancelled Flight or change itineraries booked online and that 24 hours is just about over. Impossible scenario
@AmericanAir your online site doesn't have flights listed in chronological order, resulting in a mis-purchase. Anything that can be done?
@AmericanAir the last was 2339 dfw to ord. Not weather reLate Flightd... Austin leg delayed as well
@AmericanAir you have Cancelled Flightled my flights because of my last name. Do the right thing and reinstate my tickets
@americanair flight veers off icy runway at @dfwairport. Most DFW flights Cancelled Flighted Mon http://t.co/Q37pOWn6uv @Cowboycerrone figures right?
@AmericanAir you know I love this airline, but why are my friends @MEGENTRIPODI @jordnnicole7 having such a problem retaining info they need
@AmericanAir you've got to be kidding. Look at the pictures.  I'm hoping it's on the flight that just came in. The whole story is 2 much
@AmericanAir You're clueless. A kind rez agnt contacted USAir 4me around midnite, told them what to do. If not that I'd have missed funeral.
Nice try @AmericanAir I heard your crew whisper ""she's still at the hotel, she probably doesn't think she has to work until tomorrow""
@AmericanAir I'm at the airport right now and your people didn't know how to react and help me with this situation. Very frustrated.
@AmericanAir my mom tried also. That wasn't the reason they wouldn't change it. Y'all literally said that you'd rather have an empty seat.
@AmericanAir YOU FUCKING SUCK
@AmericanAir Is this a serious thread. Maybe you guys should re-read it. #fail
@AmericanAir now on 5th plane of the day. First 4 all taken out of svc. Scheduled dep 3 p.m. Still on ground ORD 10:45pm
@AmericanAir you are beyond redemption. Jfk. Baggage claim looks like a luggage warehouse
@AmericanAir even followed me, but I still can't get them to answer their phones. Worst. Customer ""service"". Ever. #customerservice #fail
@AmericanAir yeah and what are they gunna? Nothing your whole organization is a joke
@AmericanAir 2hr and 20 min delayed...still waiting...you need to do something to improve... http://t.co/1m36NTPTR8
@AmericanAir I booked it on US Airways site. Don't see a Cancelled Flight link :(
@AmericanAir we had to sit in the airport a long periolodicly time. the planes were nasty
@AmericanAir Late Flight again geez flt2417 #Late Flight #delays #typical
@AmericanAir to add insult to injury, I have to go pick it up myself. Real class act! I'll stick the Delta from now on.
@AmericanAir absolutely disappointed in your lack of service. Lost my bag and can't even deliver it after I was told it would happen.
@AmericanAir what can AA do for a load of people about to board their 5th plane of a very long day when the first 4 were unserviceable
@AmericanAir We tried with multiple people. I already sat on the phone for an hour and a half and got nowhere.
@AmericanAir which one.?i have been booked on 6 different ones in the past 2 days
@AmericanAir Nope. Couldn't make changes online and after 90 mins on hold and time dealing w/ the rude rep, the 24 hour window has closed.
@AmericanAir doesn't care about customers, break your gear and tell u they can't do anything. @WSJ @latimes @chicagotribune #media #filmcrew
@AmericanAir unable to access the website.  Will try again.
@AmericanAir @louprice13 @aacustomerservice. Apology not good enough. 4 planes with mechanical and 9 hours delayed unacceptable.
@AmericanAir seats that were assigned are inappropriate for child this age. AA knew age of child.
@AmericanAir this is the biggest joke I've ever seen and will be telling everyone never to use you guys cause you are a joke
@AmericanAir Pay for my accommodations when you are the ones Cancelled Flightling it for no reason and I know your saying (lying) it cause of weather
@AmericanAir airport and 2 extra nights for hotels and not once have I heard of anything from your embarrassing airline saying that you will
@AmericanAir This is getting a bit ridiculous when and you have made me miss 2 full days off work and had to pay for cabs back and forth
@AmericanAir your assistance has not been very helpful frustrating disappointing experience &amp; w/small children very inconvenient
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flight my flight saying it is cause of weather condition when it was the only flight that was Cancelled Flight
@AmericanAir Again you guys are a huge joke and Cancelled Flight your flight for no reason. This is the 3rd time in one trip for me that you have
@AmericanAir WHAT IS GOING ON?  This is pathetic. Online doesn't work and phone wants $25 to give a seat assignment.
@AmericanAir This is getting out of hand. I called Reservations to reserve the seats that it won't let me select online and there's a fee...
@AmericanAir on flight 1074 that has been delayed for hours over human errors like a food truck hitting the plane, now the lines are frozen.
@AmericanAir so disappointed with this airline never again will I book with you guys
@AmericanAir You found my lost luggage, won't bring it to me until tomorrow. Next day if the weather isn't nicer. Terrible service
@AmericanAir @nrosenb1 It's not allowing me to book available seats
@AmericanAir seriously, all flights from Detroit to Dallas are Cancelled Flightled 2 days in a row. I want to get home &amp; see my wife &amp; kids.
@AmericanAir of delays and trapped on planes with no water or air. Never ever ever again. #neveragain #aafail
@AmericanAir LITERALLY just told me they'd rather have an empty seat than my mom get to come earlier &amp; take me to Dr. appointment. WOW
@AmericanAir we have posted your response on facebook for everyone to see people are appalled by your lack of concern
@AmericanAir I had an advantage # and you deactivated it. I don't think you should deactivate a customers acct without their knowledge #help
@AmericanAir thanks for making this the worst flying experience ever. 4 different planes of mechanical issues and 12 hours and counting
@AmericanAir I really wanted to sign up for your airline credit card but your absurd $400 change fee to switch my flight made me think twice
@AmericanAir she sent you an email 2 customer service the night it happened ur response was basically 2 bad sorry how should she contact u.
@AmericanAir 4369. about 4 flights all using same gate w/buses to the planes.  Awful boarding process. Hour and a half Late Flight
@AmericanAir is there another line I can call when I am on hold for 5 hours? Also how can I get compensated for this loss of time and money?
@AmericanAir @Rizzilient After days, I finally got the automated service to call me back but it hung on me! This is beyond ridicules.  help!
@AmericanAir Asked for a waiver of a change fee for flight booked w/in past 24 hrs. Rep was rude. Just told me no. Didn't even try to help!
@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.
@AmericanAir thanks to your attendant on flight for advising connect flight held.  Ran with kids and flight departed. Poor service at Miami
@AmericanAir an hour now waiting on the phone for US Air help. 10 hours waiting at the airport yesterday. Love the service guys.
@AmericanAir I'm here standing at baggage claim waiting for bags FOR OVER AN HOUR at DFW. The gate is 100 feet from here! #nothappy
@AmericanAir right so I missed my connection / had a three hour Kay over / then you lost my bag.
@AmericanAir obviously we did see an agent-booked us for tomorrow morning. No hotel, no transportation. #pregnantwithtwins #stranded #angry
@AmericanAir I was suppose to be in FL 4 hours ago. And I'm not. I've been waiting for hours this is just ridiculous
@AmericanAir you have a company policy that refuses employees to speak to other employees over the phone? Interesting
@AmericanAir still on hold. After you hung up on me the first time (another 45 minutes!) http://t.co/IMRLAu77iH
@AmericanAir if it I have not rebooked didn't get notified that it was Cancelled Flightled
Without notifying though? “@AmericanAir: @krescate We don't like Cancelled Flightling flights, Kim, but weather has not played nice with us.""
@AmericanAir customer service (if you can call it that) refunded my money
@AmericanAir you ever wonder why you find yourselves responding to so many customer complaints on twitter? It's because your airline sucks.
@AmericanAir Are you people cruel or just stupid? Why are you posting my personal email on the damn Internet? Have u lost your mind?!
@AmericanAir #customerservice. Sitting on my fourth plane today with a mechanical problem. No excuses for this. Tough to be loyal.
@AmericanAir @americanairlines #BQONPA flight #1641 delayed from POS-MIA, missed #2214 MIA- ATL need seat on last flight to ATL.
@AmericanAir SO BAD service in Miami, AirPort..
@AmericanAir needs an entire customer service overhaul @Delta would never treat its customers with anything less that A1 service
@AmericanAir are you guys intentionally trying to lose customers and money?
@AmericanAir why do you continually play the ""according to federal regulations"" every 58 seconds. I could see if you had quicker service...
@AmericanAir thanks for a Cancelled Flightled flight then a delayed flight and NOT telling us More missed work More $ on hotel #WorstCustomerService
@AmericanAir Flight 3487 delayed 1 hour because of pilots? I spend 5+ hours on the phone just to get an EP agent on the phone now this?
.@AmericanAir Advised GAs and pilot of my flight. Too bad no one took action.
@AmericanAir @USAirways need to be reported to the @BBB_media for their complete disregard for paying customers! #DoNotFlyWithThem
@AmericanAir how about you give us a number to call instead of the empty email since you are not working on it
@AmericanAir I have been checking consistently, and called multiple times. As a loyal AA customer, I'm disappointed.
@AmericanAir Gabriela in Miami is a very rude employee.Working the MIA-LGA check In. She made experience unpleasant.  #customerexperience
@AmericanAir it's not about the delay.  It's about the communication.
@AmericanAir would you like any additional details of my issue? Airport, flight, agent name? Or are you happy w/ this automated lip service?
@AmericanAir - cluster continues-still on connecting instead of direct..bag charged and seats not together. #shafted
@AmericanAir @USAirways - I'm pregnant with twins and you're going to abandon me overnight in an airport? No hotel? When it's your fault?
@AmericanAir has no idea what they're doing. Delay 1 flight from 5pm to 7:40pm then delay another TO THE SAME DESTINATION  @ THE SAME TIME.
@AmericanAir have such a bad rep for loosing costumers luggage. I stopped flying them a while back.
@AmericanAir why did you drop my call. Why don't you have more people answering phones? Why is it always high call volume when I call
@AmericanAir I can't work with them if the call gets cut off while I'm still holding..... Is DFW looking any better tomorrow?
@AmericanAir u didn't give an answer why the flight delayed so long. and how do u compensate missing my other flights Lima to Cuzco??
@AmericanAir yep as I saidi feel sorry for you that you have to run their account how embarrassing for you
@AmericanAir TSA said there is nothing they could do. But the question is why are your employee's swapping your customers belongings?
@AmericanAir now I have to wait ""more than 60 minutes""
.@AmericanAir No. I watched these bags be abandoned at depart gate. Watched for &gt;40 mins until owner returned, 20+ mins after I reported
@AmericanAir my Mistake multibillion dollar company
@AmericanAir why would it take that long? My credit card company says the card hasn't been charged yet. Should it take 5 days for this?
@AmericanAir for our delays !!! I'm out of more money because of you
@AmericanAir I have got a flight for
The next day !! What about a credit ! You guys are a multimillion dollar company give us back a Credit
@AmericanAir dont send me a tweet to cover your social media complaints. How about sending me a message with a way to resolve?!?! #CustServ
@AmericanAir @barrettkarabis what a joke you can mail
The receipt !! Yet. We can't mail
Them
A payment and fly before hand right
@AmericanAir Why doesn't anyone make a better effort to retain customers. It should be an easy fix, I just want to travel AA.
@AmericanAir btr trained gate agts. Im a frequent flyer &amp; have nvr had issue w/my bag 2day I was forced 2 gate check while priority boarding
@AmericanAir misplaced my bag 36 hr ago and can't tell me where it is. I've lost $1000 of stuff :( #AmericanAirlines #unamericanairlines
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled two flights from Miami to Nashville yesterday and could not get me on a flight for 3-4 days. #Southwestairwasthere
@AmericanAir lost 3 pieces of our bags, haven't delivered them in 36 hours, lied that they were delivered, and still no refund.  Never again
@AmericanAir improve Envoy's performance.  5th trip through ORD in 2015 I've been delayed for hours because of Envoy.  I could drive faster!
@AmericanAir two Cancelled Flightled LGA flights. Both by @Delta took off. Looks like I have a new carrier @Delta!
@AmericanAir any ways to get through the 50 minute wait to book a flight?
@AmericanAir Really?They closed the gate at 10:30 instead of40.I got there at 10:39. If u wudda put in my ktn like I asked, I wudda made it.
@AmericanAir trying to change flight via DFW tomorrow, can't get thru on phone, long wait then cut off x2, can you help please?
@AmericanAir stuck on the tarmac in CLT because the our gate is not open. Hope I don't miss my connection.... #logistics #AmericanView
@AmericanAir I waited on hold for two hours, only to have my call. Really unreliable.
@AmericanAir now a delay to the rebooked flight?!
@AmericanAir after several miss communications I was able to get to ORD but I am not home yet and not sure I will get there due to her error
@AmericanAir Hey, AA! There was a mistake made by your CR on my Flight Booking Problems. When I call your reservations #, I keep getting hung up on. Advise.
@AmericanAir not having pillows or blankets or a flight home for 40 people does bad things to my hair
@AmericanAir What are we going to do about the nightmare you guys out me through yesterday? Zero response from the tweet you last sent me.
@AmericanAir I tried site &amp; doesnt allow me. Same reason why I wasn't allowed to board this morning. Will try diff airline for work trips
@AmericanAir I bought a plane ticket 2 months ago and still haven't received my flight info and ticket in my email when it will come?
@AmericanAir your DCA baggage claim employees should realize a please, a thank you and an apology can go a long way #customerservice #DCA
@AmericanAir  2/2 You took cost for both flights out of my bank account. Now I can't get a refund for 2 weeks? I have been a loyal customer.
@AmericanAir I took the day off from work and drove 9 hours round trip to rescue my daughter and 3 other students from LaGuardia. Thanks!
@AmericanAir you're airline is ridiculous
@AmericanAir the group of minor children were broken up into groups. Some still in Miami. Delta has much better customer service!
@AmericanAir that's the one. My original arrival time was 10:14am, after all said and done I may be there by 9:19pm central. Not impressed.
@AmericanAir My flight 1389 from Las Vegas to DFW was Cancelled Flightled! I've been on hold forever and I still have not spoken to anyone! Pls Help
@AmericanAir every time I try to call, it tells me to try again Late Flightr and just hangs up.
@AmericanAir rebooked into a different airport. Throwing a wrench into plans 
@AmericanAir crew did the best they could but it was out of their control. You only get one chance of a honeymoon &amp; you failed miserably
@AmericanAir that's unacceptable
@AmericanAir so what if I didn't have the funds to purchase another ticket? Your error would cause my family to miss the funeral
@AmericanAir I have to miss a whole days worth of work tomorrow but I'm suree you guys don't care
@AmericanAir this is a big company should be happy to do something for a customer when now it's costing more for delays oh and did I mention
@AmericanAir and just bad cs! I will be back on @JetBlue  at least when you stuck they look out for you and apologize for any trouble
@AmericanAir for my delay and you know what I get a we don't credit anybody back a supervisor who cut me off when speaking
@AmericanAir yes I did but no response.
@AmericanAir my bags were checked through to Cancelled Flightled flight 362. When will they arrive in MKE? Not much help from grnd staff. Havoc in DFW
@AmericanAir I'd just like to know where my bag is, when I'll get it and why I don't have it already. No accountability from Cust Service.
@AmericanAir I will never fly with you guys again! I am stuck in memphis another day. Called to be credit something anything
@AmericanAir @Rizzilient I booked tickets using miles and need to change the dates.  Have been trying to get to an advantage rep 4 two days
@AmericanAir is the company from hell with NO consideration for customers that give it hundreds of millions of dollars per year #SMH
@AmericanAir Took a flight yesterday fron TPA-DFW-AUS. Bag went to IAH. Today bag went to IAH-DFW and then back to IAH. Still no bag!
@AmericanAir it is absolutely unacceptable.  I have been calling all day and am hung up on every time. I just need a 5 minute bit of help!
@AmericanAir - Envoy Airlines is a disgrace to the AA family.  Nothing but delays and Cancelled Flightlations, week after week.
@AmericanAir It's not about weather, it's logistics. Why should I hold for 90 minutes when you called me? Why not get more desk agents?
@AmericanAir I've never had anything bad to say until now. No love for faithful customers.
@AmericanAir Also Agent not aware clearly of http://t.co/FWKJ49B1LE
@AmericanAir Additional fare cost $19.. Tix change price 195 UK Pounds ($304). $19 not the issue the 195 UK Pounds IS ! #badcustomerservice
@AmericanAir No Meelan did not afford a supervisor to be included in the conversation, pls check the rec of the call #badcustomerservice
@AmericanAir I had it until last night, but because ""severe weather"" I could make the needed changes and now fair goes up 150 each.
@AmericanAir has the worst flight change policy. No mercy, no sympathy, such a bummer when you can't go to funerals or see friends bc of it.
@AmericanAir just messaged you. Please have someone contact us immediately.
@AmericanAir 3349, was supposed to be in little rock at 10am this morning.
@AmericanAir already spoke to that line, unwilling to help - really poor support #hitawall
@AmericanAir not only on both legs did I have damaged seat, u damaged an expensive case and not offered anything.Just an apology 6wks Late Flightr!
@AmericanAir @USAirways I've tried to be understanding and let you handle the situation but I guess I was wrong about that
@AmericanAir @USAirways over an hour on the phone the best you can tell me is it was sent maybe my bank misplaced it...
@AmericanAir @USAirways day has come where I was suppose to get my money back from you but my bank hasn't received anything but after
@AmericanAir no I will be calling corporate!
@AmericanAir cannot understand how you are part of oneworld all other member treat their customers fairly #tcf #oldplanes #damageluggage
@AmericanAir probs the worst customer service ever. Replied to complaint I submitted 6 weeks ago bout damaged bag... Not even replacing it!
@AmericanAir I Cancelled Flightled my ticket and is taking two months ++ to refund and still waiting!
@AmericanAir thanks for being entirely unhelpful and wasting hours of my time today
@AmericanAir check on what? Our broken tablet! See attached picture. #media #filmcrew #nbc #cnn http://t.co/Uq2ooPjPwg
@AmericanAir been calling all morning. Still can't get through. I need to chge a flight that is this week!!!!!
@AmericanAir should prob give me a refund since they made me miss my flight waiting to talk to someone for 3 hours... http://t.co/4SFpcbyy9m
@AmericanAir Bad weather happens. But not being able to get through to a reservations rep for over 6 hours is just crazy. #frustrated
@AmericanAir why are customer svc reps unable to handle calls. Is there a 24hrs Cancelled Flightlation policy? Booked yesterday need to Cancelled Flight
@AmericanAir Bad weather is understandable but your own pilot said that over 160 people called out and that ZERO bags are on the plane.
@AmericanAir yep,filed a claim at Heathrow yesterday. We were promised a call this morning with an update, but got nothing.
@AmericanAir why is does it seem to be impossible to contact anyone at your airline to get an item left on board a plane 5 min after deplane
@AmericanAir stuck at gate Miami to JFK flight 1510. Are we going to get out of here tonight? Very frustrating
@AmericanAir I understand they're busy &amp; doing their best. My frustration is an automated call changing my flight w/o allowing me to talk
@AmericanAir has been almost a month and still no response to my online complaint/questions. Out $300 because of it.
@AmericanAir bad weather happens but lack of preparation is inexcusable. Depending on good weather is not a good business model.
@AmericanAir how is US4623 going to be on time when they are still deplaning at 4:08? This is BS.
@AmericanAir instead they yelled at him and told him to call a number that will not pick up due to call volume
@AmericanAir he is at the Boston airport. There is a problem. The agents will not honor the voucher because one number is rubbed out.
@AmericanAir I guess it is more BS AirportCardio given you cannot have an on time flight
@AmericanAir you should really explain customer service to your gate agent for 1152 at C4. Couldn't be bothered.
@AmericanAir I've been trying to get through to reservations since yesterday to make a change to a reservation hold, when will it be up?
@AmericanAir thanks - I miss my dog and this delay is costing me a lot of money.
@AmericanAir I still can't get through to change my flight. This is really important plz help!
@AmericanAir I ended up emailing my #Complaint to customer.relations@aa.com, hope that works. #TravelProblems
@AmericanAir can lie to you about where your lost bag is, but we are suppose to trust them with our lives thousands of feet in the air...
@AmericanAir Can't help now as all seats have been taken.  There has to be a way to handle high volume of call days.
@AmericanAir the worst first class boarding service I ever had.
@AmericanAir most disgusting chicken entree I've ever seen.  Your standards have seriously nosedived. #NewAmerican http://t.co/56eSsfOOwt
@AmericanAir im tryin to book a flight but cant get ahold of anyone!
@AmericanAir finally at final destination but not w/o extra significant travel expenses &amp; missed work. How can you resolve this experience?
@AmericanAir Another customer non service from you. If we waited for you to solve the problem we would miss the funeral. You suck!
@AmericanAir already shared with them. Nothing done!
@AmericanAir @kanne822 @SouthwestAir is better than AA.
@AmericanAir while listening to a delay message on my phone, another delay message was coming in. Get your shit together!
@AmericanAir there's an employee at gate 45 of JFK telling people their bag doesn't fit and needs to be checked when it clearly fits #AA291
@AmericanAir after waiting for a delayed plane, we sat on the plane for an hour waiting for a Late Flight passenger. That's BS too..
@AmericanAir WHERE IS MY BAG?!?!?!
@AmericanAir Not true!! Stop making excuses! You either overbook or have crappy planes!
@AmericanAir no. Booked seat in Dallas, live in Dallas. Real nice that your gate agent had exit row available told me they weren't available
@AmericanAir that's why I'm asking for exception. Staffer moving last minute,we're a nonprofit &amp; losing $400,we just want to change ticket.
@AmericanAir your advantage agents are horrible! I've been waiting for 5 hours for a call back only to be hung up on by a rude agent!
@AmericanAir yes there's issues on the site as well unfortunately.
@americanair the best is your 800 message saying to use website and your website is saying you need to call.  If you don't answer, #hardtodo
@AmericanAir Trying to get my flight changed through dallas. Calling your number just says thanks for calling and hangs up. Guess I'm stuck
@AmericanAir AA1675 now that the airplane has been sitting here for over 24 hrs,there are mechanical problems.BTW,the AA desk is unorganized
@AmericanAir Miami-PhL flight Cancelled Flightled just as I got to the gate. No one from AA around, no one on the phone. Awful awful awful.
@AmericanAir Can care less if youre without your bags for a day or a week! Ive been 3 stories in the last 3 hours...I WANT MY BAG!
@AmericanAir hah, best flight attendant response, if you not happy getting screwed over, you have other carriers.   hahahah pathetic
@AmericanAir AA1675 flight out of Jamaica was Cancelled Flightled yesterday due to ""weather"", while other flights were still landing at DFW
@AmericanAir your a LIAR, no precipitation all day, 47 degrees, don't pacify, you look like a fool.......thats the problem, admit you suck
@AmericanAir 12 calls in the span of two days........none of which available to speak to someone.  You are un F-in believable.  worst ever
@AmericanAir @elwoodblues77 I'm sure he understands the rules but you guys just have zero customer service. Staff your damn counters!
.@AmericanAir after 50 minutes on hold, and another 30 minutes on the call yes. Going to be pushing it to get to the airport on time now
@AmericanAir your seat assignment process when Flight Booking Problems is misleading. I'm not paying extra to select a seat.
@AmericanAir why can't you hire a staff that is helpful, informed and nice to it's customers?
@AmericanAir from the rude ticket counter employees to forcing my wife on standby and then pushing her down the list.. it was a very bad day
@AmericanAir Agents in DFW were very kind did their best to help, but this doesn't make up for PHX error and attitude! #Americant
@AmericanAir will not let me reuse my ticket.  Thus I have booked my vacation with Delta!  Never flying on American again......
@AmericanAir now 2 hrs! Guess I should just hang up &amp; give up on using my award miles before prices jump? Hm thanks http://t.co/LE4H2gTzXZ
@AmericanAir Need to hold or get a call back. Just get hung up on by your phone system for 6+ hours now.
@AmericanAir she was rude, unprofessional,  not helpful in helping me try and get home. As a #aaadvantage #loyal aa customer dissatisfied!
@AmericanAir work on the comm skills w hate agents at PHX. Said I was confirmed on flight out of DFW &amp; got here and that was only standby.
@AmericanAir I'm trying my hardest to not get frustrated, but I am getting no response on email or by phone. AA owes me $500. How do I claim
@AmericanAir 2nd time in 4 days that my flight has been delayed and my gate agent hasn't said anything! Thanks for the memories. #NeverAgain
@AmericanAir have been in call cue for 11 hours. No call yet. Wife in cue for 9 hours.  Got a call but was hung up on.
@AmericanAir been on the phone for 47 minutes...said it would be 10...  Any advice?
@AmericanAir I don't believe it's acceptable to have a ticket # changed after check in time &amp; not be notified. Apparently that's standard.
@AmericanAir I need to complain to AA, but the email form field doesn't allow enough characters for my complaint. Have a real email address?
@AmericanAir our flight AA 1338 is delayed out of Providenciales and will be missing our connection AA 1651 in Miami to SEA. Who do we call?
@AmericanAir here is the ticket they gave me after lying, raising their voice. With no explanation on what happened http://t.co/31cFHtK60r
@AmericanAir we did check before going to de airport and everything was fine. #fail
@AmericanAir attached original ticket. flight number was 1672. isn't the experience I thought I would have. Terrible! http://t.co/5SdlyN9MSS
@AmericanAir This entire process took sooooo long that no decent seats are left.  #customerservice
@AmericanAir been on hold to reserve award travel for over 1.5 hrs now. Anyone home?? Or is it a crazy weather issue? http://t.co/cEHrOeurC5
@AmericanAir the original receipt lists my flight cost as $89ish, and doesn't reflect the use of a voucher
@AmericanAir Least you could do would be to refund me the one-way ticket I had to buy since you weren't able to accommodate. Thank you.
@AmericanAir After being patient about my ""delayed"" bags for 5 weeks, I was told that it could take another 3 to 5 weeks. Unacceptable!
@AmericanAir I had to purchase a ticket that I never would have had to buy had the flight not been Cancelled Flightled. Terrible customer service.
@AmericanAir flt 703, sorry scheduled at 545, phl-mia, a totally chaotic, poorly addressed event.  Sent to three gates in the night
@AmericanAir Was told you could only refund me the cost of my original return flight (note: flight you had booked for me was more expensive)
@AmericanAir Not okay. Since you couldn't put me on an earlier flight, I had to buy my own ticket on another airline.
@AmericanAir Heard back at 7:30 am today, was put on flight tomorrow AM, arriving home at 4 pm. Meaning I'd have to take a 2nd day off work.
@AmericanAir been @ airport 8hrs been told nothing by anyone until now your rep has said ""we are waiting for the mechanics to finish lunch""!
@AmericanAir, I've tried no less than 8 times today to get in touch with your service desk beginning at 8:30 EST.  I'm having no luck -help!
@AmericanAir Was put on hold for 5.5 hrs then got a call back at 11:20 pm, only to wait on hold for another hour.
@AmericanAir You lost a customer today. Flight today was Cancelled Flightled and I had to find out by calling customer service yesterday.
@AmericanAir Just called regarding my bag, came in yesterday and no one notified more or updated the online record locator #customerservice
@AmericanAir to realize your customer service leaves much to be desired and the folks handling the calls could care less...and it shows.
@AmericanAir unacceptable. It's clear losing just one customer doesn't matter to American but how many more bankruptcies will it take
@AmericanAir will do on another airline that's more accommodating of its customers. Unable to simply change passengers with notice is simply
@AmericanAir is there a way to reserve my dog’s flight without speaking with a representative? Just was booted from your helpline!
@AmericanAir I've been calling you for 3 straight days and no one picks up. Sure there are storms but there are also #customers Holler!
@AmericanAir it's GTSVYB. It says it's Cancelled Flightled when I try to check.
@AmericanAir ; @USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Unprofessional, unprepared, unsympathetic, lacked communication, and lacked solutions.
@AmericanAir hey ho its not me losing any money (only you) just next make sure you stick to the ""flyers right's booklet""
@AmericanAir Trying for 20 hrs to reach agent. Must make change that can't be done on web by 11:59 PST. Had to Cancelled Flight revs ystday.
@AmericanAir Oh, and losing my luggage #ridiculous # angrybird # where'smybag
@AmericanAir please get it together and find my husbands luggage! You're ruining his ski trip to Aspen! 3rd day no luggage.
@AmericanAir sure is. What's more frustrating is being stranded at the airport with our fate in your hands.
@AmericanAir thanks for telling me my flight got Cancelled Flightled when it wasn't. Now I have a missing luggage because of you. Thanks fam!
@AmericanAir 77min still on hold to chg award travel #sorrynotsorry
@AmericanAir Your people on the phone can't see those? And to have it be over $800 difference. That's a poor process then...
@AmericanAir still not taking calls ?   Storm ended 2 days ago. Be like pats and #doyourjob
@AmericanAir not helpful
@AmericanAir you expect us to spend our hard earn $ to fly and make exceptions when you have extra call volume, however, you never make acpt
@AmericanAir hour and a half after landing bags are finally trickling off. http://t.co/4KbTzVjU3b
@AmericanAir 2 hours now!  No I'm not patient.  Why don't you have a call back feature or pay someone to answer the phone, not tweet #onhold
@AmericanAir please do something about boarding at DCA 35X. Many delays + buses to planes on tarmac despite empty gates. Disorganized mess.
@AmericanAir no standby line update online or on app either is troubling
@AmericanAir Unbelievable that I cannot even wait on hold to speak to a human being to resolve my issue!!!!!!!! The system simply hangs up!
@americanair thanks to your airline I now have a ruined bag and you refuse to do anything about it.
@AmericanAir 4 open kiosks for priority with no line and only 4 open for main check in for ~80-100 ppl
@AmericanAir I have the app - after my nonsense flight Cancelled Flightation yesterday I wasn't able to use the app or kiosk today. Hour long line.
@AmericanAir Thank u! Did reach out to both and have not had a response yet. Lost and Found goes straight to VM.
@AmericanAir ""bag has not yet been located"". Again, 5th time I've checked it. How can tracking my bag be this hard for your system?
@AmericanAir Still on hold. Way to suck.
@AmericanAir are flights leaving Dallas right now? In Maui trying to figure out how delayed flight 7 is going to be
@AmericanAir, ask your new colleagues @USAirways how they handled US 728 on 21 Feb. I expect to be made whole again. Check complaint inbox.
@AmericanAir get me outta here
@americanair just tried calling. got a high call volume at this moment message and then it said goodbye and hung up…
@AmericanAir don't they already know ?  Isn't everyone sharing how nasty the food is? It's not even close to decent.
@AmericanAir did you guys get rid of the functionality on http://t.co/R1OQAVEO7I to put a reservation on hold for 24 hours? i don't see it
@AmericanAir On hold since 5am. When no one can get to the airport, Cancelled Flight flight, don't make us pay huge fee to change flight.
@AmericanAir so if your genuine, give me your opinion  on what occurred last night 445 fly  from phl, to mia. No assistance at airport
@AmericanAir How can I get a flight change while in the air? Delays causing a missed connection again. There is 1 seat for Late Flightr
@AmericanAir I think 2 weeks of waiting is more than enough time for you to contact me.  This is why you lose customers
@AmericanAir Way to suck at customer service, Dallas is trapped in an ice storm but you didn't Cancelled Flight 7am flight &amp; been on hold all day.
@AmericanAir umm unexpected?? Unexpected meaning you guys didn't know you had a major staff shortage ??
@AmericanAir Also do you have any way to speak to someone on the phone? Your 1-800 # has been hanging up on me all day.
@AmericanAir I paid seat upgrade b4 the severe weather.  Got booked on another flight but did not get upgrade. Was calling to inquire. HELP!
@AmericanAir You don't care about keeping your customers safe or at least you didn't care about my sister
@AmericanAir maybe you should stop tweeting and start calling. Or make it available for people to wait on-hold instead of hanging up on us.
@AmericanAir, that's not the point. Say its $1300 at the counter when I clearly see $500 on your site? AA agent was @ a loss 4 words, too
@AmericanAir When will callers from the East Coast be able to speak to an actual human for reservation support? All agents busy call Late Flightr..
@AmericanAir 249 EWR - DFW is now stopping BNA to refuel 4 bad weather? Are YOU just trying to get the plane closer 2 DFW then Cancelled Flight on us?
@AmericanAir is there something wrong with the website? no matter what flight I select, it says it's no longer available.
@AmericanAir now you're sending a gate agent to talk to us? Joke of an airline. Thanks for ruining my vacation. #neverflyAAagain
@AmericanAir we have been sitting on the plane for over an hour. unacceptable. you have a complete disregard for customer service.
@AmericanAir Only fluctuated because aa took 2 hrs to call me back.Ended up paying (extra) in $US so above statement not true
@AmericanAir you keep returning my call and hanging up when I answer? Help reFlight Booking Problems a flight!
@AmericanAir been calling for over 24hrs now and getting no where but told to call back by the automated system is extremely frustrating
@AmericanAir @USAirways you can help by now finding my baggage!!  Reply to me ASAP with who I can direct details to.
@AmericanAir 4hrs Late Flightr i get a call back, and immediately disconnected
@AmericanAir your team rebooked my Cancelled Flightled AA flight on a different airline. New airline has no such Flight Booking Problems. Flight is this evening.
@AmericanAir why have I been on hold for almost 3 hours? This is ridiculous
@AmericanAir I don't like making a scene but this hasn't been addressed properly. Please have them do that.
@AmericanAir @derekc21  Hello any one out there ? have you forgotten me ?  I need a  luggage # for BA.  Your dropping the ball here .
@AmericanAir am on hold for the 2nd time today. Need help with confirming the new flights you arranged for me. Can you expedite this?
@AmericanAir served the nastiest food Ive ever seen yesterday.Rubber chicken in slime. The ENTIRE cabin sent their food back.FAs can confirm
@AmericanAir  terrible response! How about someone picking up the phone and calling me...It is now 49 Hours with no luggage
@AmericanAir really
@AmericanAir how can I when system always hangs up on me?
@AmericanAir in line at SFO. Customer service is rude, disorganized, and congested. Very dissapointing.
@AmericanAir HELP! Attempting to Cancelled Flight a flight but can't get thru 800 number. Call gets dropped when saying Agent. flight is 2/24.
@AmericanAir @EdPlotts don't bother trying to get anywhere with their customer service team either as take 2+ months and counting to reply
@AmericanAir seriously, you treat your passengers like shit.
@americanair 30 minutes since landing - flight 1531 from Miami and no luggage- what's the delay
@AmericanAir got it, so it's just paying extra not to sit in the way back. Awesome. Never again.
@AmericanAir Define ""sincerely"". Your actions do not reflect what you're saying in a poor attempt to redeem yourselves on social media.
@AmericanAir @usairways who is the next stop after customer service.
@AmericanAir you said this last time. It doesn't take 6 weeks to reply to an email.
@AmericanAir 45min wait to get de-iced in Tulsa.Not good service.Looks like everyone will miss connections, not due to weather. Fight is on
@AmericanAir ...why would you sell seats for a 7 hour flight with half of the legroom occupied by an escape raft? http://t.co/DTHEyOFXrB
@AmericanAir My flight through Dallas was Cancelled Flightled and I talked to reservations agent and got a new flight but have not received an email
@AmericanAir #last #flight #ever on #AA. You botched this weather delay to the point of absurdity. I'd pay more to fly @Delta
@AmericanAir - I'd be happy to hold on the phone, but your phone system is not allowing that and simply hangs up.
@AmericanAir Trying desperately to rebook my moms flight. Waited 10 hours for callback, got disconnected and they didn’t call back. #help
@AmericanAir Thanks but don't understand why they couldn't have used the tug at the next gate over, ground crew took a break? #unacceptable
@AmericanAir That will be the third time I have been called by 800-433-7300 an hung on before anyone speaks. What do I do now???
@AmericanAir now the second flight I was put on was Cancelled Flightled with no explanation!! Missed my first meeting!!#outraged
@AmericanAir How clueless is AA. Been waiting to hear for 2.5 weeks about a refund from a Cancelled Flightled flight &amp; been on hold now for 1hr 49min
@AmericanAir No! We departed 24 hours Late Flightr, with a crazy crew. One of the lady simply freaked out and got away from job before departure.
@AmericanAir Don't require us to memorize a five-word phrase and remember it after we hear another six million options
@AmericanAir you can tweet but not call! You're like a bad boyfriend!
@AmericanAir @British_Airways trying to speak with an agent about my flight to London tonight but can't get anyone from AA.  Can you help?
@AmericanAir Oh,i already have turned  itover to them, but apparently losing someones bag on their honeymoon doesn't require accountability
@AmericanAir I've been trying to reach your customer service for TWO days. I have received zero response. Never traveling AA again.
@AmericanAir 6 hours to get backs back after being sat on a plane for 4 hours to have flight Cancelled Flightled with only one small drink
@AmericanAir @CNN @nbsnewsr @cnnbrk except you aren't working with her @AmericanAir youve done nothing to help
@AmericanAir you need to have a look at your handling of flight 106 and 104. Company of yours size should have protocols in place to help
@AmericanAir literally just stopped allowing people to wait in line for customer service. Incredible. From worst to no customer service.
@AmericanAir We've 15 official complaints signed by #AmericanAirlines Lima supervisor. Customer Relations pls compensate 4 the 10-hour delay
@AmericanAir I need to rebook and I cannot get an agent. Can you help?
@AmericanAir back in UK now no thanks to your staff that wouldn't me or the other passengers stranded. Just laughed at us
@AmericanAir Well if you won't let me handle my reservation/change online, &amp; your Reservation call # hangs up on me wtf do I do?? Bullshit.
@AmericanAir received an email requesting I call about a res. but I keep getting kicked off of your phone system. Help?
@AmericanAir flight Cancelled Flightled and was trying to reschedule but 800 number just says to call back
@AmericanAir and feel free to email me mikehertz7@gmail.com - don't worry, we're not going anywhere but this damn Tarmac for a bit!
@AmericanAir because your plane's toilet wasn't working and they needed gas. This is flight 1081 leaving Dulles going to LAX. Do some...
@AmericanAir you're not finding it bc @united  rebooked us on your airline when they realized they couldn't get us home - and we're at ORD
@AmericanAir Funny you should say that. I have been monitoring since January 1st. No change in availability. #fakeawards #LUVisbetter
@AmericanAir flight home Cancelled Flightled today.  Any way we can get another flight to NYC from Texas? 4 hour wait for a call back from airline
@AmericanAir @justynmoro I totally agree.  You get the automatic phone attendent that goes NO WHERE and hangs up.  Lousy service!
@AmericanAir I've been trying to call your reservations desk for past 12 hours and can't get through.  This is not what I expected.
@AmericanAir customer service is terrible.Been waiting 6 weeks for a reply to an email. Not helpful at all and keep brushing off problems!
@AmericanAir it's taken care of already. I've come to expect this level of horrible service from you time and time again
@americanair why am I not being given a callback option??! Why has this service been turned off?
@AmericanAir Ok. We will probably Cancelled Flight our flights then, take a refund, and get home another way. Wednesday won't work for us.
@AmericanAir Also, I have to wait more than 2 hours before I can speak to someone on the phone?  I can't wait 2 hours.  :(
@AmericanAir How am I supposed to Cancelled Flight it if I can't do it online?  I don't want to lose all the funds on the ticket.  HELP!!! :(
@AmericanAir poor customer service is just unacceptable.. Also how bout the surfer on the front of your website. #noloveforsurfers #pretend
@AmericanAir I need HELP!  I'm trying to Cancelled Flight a flight before it takes off but I can't get a hold of ANYONE because all lines are busy.
@AmericanAir Trying  to Cancelled Flight fligt 2321 O'Hare to Dallas 12:17pm. High call volume no one answer. Online no confirmation. #thankU
@AmericanAir No I was not given the choice by the rep Meelan (UK AA Contact Center) to escaLate Flight to a supervisor and had to book with change
@AmericanAir Retrain in Customer Service first, make proper adjustments when Cancelled Flightling flights. Own up to your Mistakes.
@AmericanAir wish you had a better mobile app.  You should look at the app from @united as it is much more seemless to check in
@AmericanAir delayed flight six hours. Missed international connection= extra night in a hotel and still have to pay for a 15lb surfboardbag
@AmericanAir no vouchers 4 Cancelled Flighted flight due 2 weather. Today's issue, broken tire. No vouchers cause tire was broken by weather. #nomoAA
@AmericanAir worst airline! You Cancelled Flight our flight and don't even let us know even though we are traveling with children.
@AmericanAir long mait. Repair wait at gate - Capt Said ""paperwork formality""- forced to check bag rudely-returning CC reader doesn't work
@AmericanAir One hour to check in is 45 minutes too long. MIA FAIL.
@AmericanAir thx for showing me that your Twitter appreciates me more than your employees. Sure another airline would like my $1300 #nohotel
@AmericanAir I can't get through to a customer rep to help me out. This is the only option I have got.
@AmericanAir She could even see that I had tried to make the transaction but wouldn't offer me the price I'd tried to purchase it at.
@AmericanAir @united we'll have time and they aren't doing a damn thing. I'm the guy in the winter hat and frowny face
@AmericanAir So much for Status, EP and 1.5 million miles.  Revenue First class ticket and Im sitting in Coach thanks your rude CS staff
@AmericanAir @united just deplaned at O'Hare gate K13. Why don't you send a customer service rep to discuss my situation? God knows...
@AmericanAir By the time the 2 hrs passed before I got a call back, the ticket was more $$. It wasn't my fault yet I had to pay extra
@AmericanAir No, it wouldn't let me complete transaction because it was one way from Barbados to NYC
@AmericanAir: my brother's flight into DFW was Cancelled Flightled yesterday. Are you flying from ONT to DFW today?
@AmericanAir the customer service today is unsat, Flight cnx, not notified, called for 6 hours and the phone line does not even let me hold
@AmericanAir I'm still patiently waiting for a response to my complaint email on Fri. What is the normal response time?
@AmericanAir the flight I'm trying to change is in 4 hours and I've been trying to reach an agent for 72 now. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
@AmericanAir Why is it ok that no-one can help me with the bag you lost on my honeymoon 3months ago, this is not responsible or professional
@AmericanAir SJC-&gt;LAX. After the fourth time, I gave up!
@AmericanAir my flight to San Angelo via Dallas from Orlando Cancelled Flighted help! On hold and disconnect
@AmericanAir @_Lucy_May surely much better to let us all share the feedback unless you have something to hide?
@AmericanAir your staff at JFK airport are discussing the way we we're left stranded
@AmericanAir still no response from AA. great job guys!
@AmericanAir confused at the definition of a ""preferred seat."" I paid extra for one and got a regular seat with no legroom. Unimpressed.
@AmericanAir Oh yea? That's it? C'mon buddy! Bring your special friend @united to the conversation - they seem to be doing NOTHING AT ALL
@AmericanAir why are there only 2 agents at domestic check in at MIA?! WTF? Huge lines and many people with Cancelled Flightled flights.
@AmericanAir I was told I had a 20minute wait time after waiting hours. And an hour has gone by. This is ridiculous
@AmericanAir you guys need to educate your employees on what a pink tag is AND STOP LOSING MY GUITAR FOR THE 10 THOUSANDTH TIME!
@AmericanAir pretty frustrating when you can't even stay on hold to get help after a flight Cancelled Flightation!
@AmericanAir @united You're both equally terrible, and I'm going to fight until I get complete satisfaction for how we were mistreated
@AmericanAir @united contact me, or do something to alleviate this terrible, terrible service. But no, your 22 year old social media guru
@AmericanAir @united week is going to make up for anything, or put me at ease.  You should be asking me how you can fix things, how to...
@AmericanAir @cnnbrk they didn't address the assult or drinks spilled on her  the drunk passenger had to have a wheelchair to get off plane
@AmericanAir @united and a complete lack of faith in your companies. It's really a shame that you think telling me ""it's been a challenging""
@AmericanAir Priority baggage evidently means it comes out last
@AmericanAir @united getting us to where we need to be. This is not acceptable. Not to mention, Cancelled Flighting meetings/interviews for my client
@AmericanAir between your airline and @united I've now spent three extra days traveling (DOMESTIC) and spent hundreds of dollars...
@AmericanAir has the worst flights and customer service, this is the second time I've been Cancelled Flighted. Gotta pay for hotel and find rides now.
@AmericanAir flight from DC to LA, not to mention fix the circuit breaker in our bathrooms because this plane is as old as me...
@AmericanAir what an incredibly arrogant thing to say while I sit here at O'Hare waiting for your incompetent airlines to refuel on a...
@AmericanAir @cnnbrk she tried they are not doing anything said they would talk to stewardess about serving drunks drinks how does that help
@AmericanAir please improve business extra flight reservation process. can't book online?  what century are we in? 25 min+ on hold
@AmericanAir I tried already and I am on the waiting list for a call back #2hourwaitsucks
@AmericanAir the most stressful morning and still had to pay to check a bag. LAX is a madhouse with a lot of angry customers. Yikes
@AmericanAir as of now, will do my best to never fly w/ #AmericanAirlines ever again. Y'all have made this a day to remember.
@AmericanAir 4 phone calls, 2 hrs of being sent back &amp; forth between two lines in the terminal and it's the skycap that finds a solution
@AmericanAir Thanks for the response.Tough night for all involved. Our flight got Cancelled Flightled as we started taxiing down the runway.
@AmericanAir what response? Is our flight out of Montrose Cancelled Flightled or not?
@AmericanAir thanks for the DM rescheduling. Unfortunately your operations process at LAX is chaos &amp; the reps refused to print the ticket
@AmericanAir No. I was told I got put on another flight and that I would get an email. Still haven't gotten one yet.
@AmericanAir Please try it yourself - call 1-800-433-7300 and see what happens... then you'll understand.  #allrepresentativesbusy #nooption
@AmericanAir I tried to check in, but they redirect me to call in to @USAirways, which I also can't get into contact with
@AmericanAir flight delayed 3 times today due to flight officer. 4333 from pit to ord. 5 hour delay to date. #bademployeeproblem?
@AmericanAir --(pt 2) and the AA reservations phone number has been less than helpful, telling me to change things online when I can't.
@AmericanAir yes but not with much help from you guys
@AmericanAir I understand that. But 14 hours Late Flightr, I still haven't heard a word! How can you plan your week with no zero information!
@AmericanAir My reservation is on hold, not me.  Wish I was on hold but that's not possible with the phone issues at #americanair
@AmericanAir You are having phone issues.  Please fix it!!!!
@AmericanAir I can't!!!  No one can't get to ""hold"".  You can't get past the automated reply.  It hangs up on you.  #FRUSTRATED
@AmericanAir trying to get home is beyond complicated. It's should not be this hard. Students are split up and we will not fly AA ever again

@AmericanAir they @cathaypacific @cathaypacificUS can't even tell me what country they are in 
@AmericanAir yes. Just sayin' that was a particularly poorly handled situation.
@AmericanAir I had to pay extra $$ cos that flight was ""no longer available"" just because it wouldn't accept my US Card for a 1 way into NYC
@AmericanAir - And @AirSouthwest  had a flight from Chicago to Buffalo about an hour before our flight -- do they not care about safety?
@AmericanAir - So does that mean your other flights going into Buffalo from other locations, you don't care about their safety?
@AmericanAir I've been in line for over half hour trying to see a representative, now I might even miss the next flight too, unacceptable
@AmericanAir been trying to speak to agent for 24hrs about my Cancelled Flightled flight but reps always busy. how do I get ahold of you?

@AmericanAir on hold again....estimated 2 hr hold
@AmericanAir Supervisor M.Robinson just served a lot of attitude, Cancelled Flighted my flight out of spite, then put me back on on #crazybitch
@AmericanAir at gate c11. Your gate agents are turning paying customers away in favor of non revs
@AmericanAir @andyellwood @delk lol. I was sure I'd wake up to more of a response than this half-thought auto tweet. hope you made it out.
@AmericanAir AA2334 Second week in a row delayed, due to mechanical issues. All the sleet outside and yet we're stuck changing a tire
@AmericanAir keep trying to call to change reservation and you keep hanging up on me
@AmericanAir hahahaha! This is crazy! Well here's to another night at the airport!!
@AmericanAir @hoagy10 how about you stop cutting and pasting apologies and get some additional phone reps to do their jobs
@AmericanAir work would be much better with my lesson plans and music for my classes today.
@AmericanAir your call system is a fucking joke
@AmericanAir You moved us onto 6.55pm but there is availability on 1.50 and 3.30.   No answer on your phone. Have young children.  HELP!
@AmericanAir It's our honeymoon,I paid extra business. I was sitting next to my bride, you bumped me because of status. Disgusted
@AmericanAir Deplaned for the 3rd fucking time. Fuck you AA.
@AmericanAir how do I redeem a travel voucher for a flight if I can't reach a travel agent by phone? My hold expires in 24 hours
@AmericanAir it has been almost 4 hours and I have heard nothing yet from your reservations team. What am I supposed to do?
@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight due to ""weather"" when others are flying out just fine.  No compensation, no resolution.  Incompetent.
@AmericanAir 8 hours on the phone yesterday.  Really?  Still doesn't pick up status on US Air flight.
@AmericanAir worst experience ever. @VirginAmerica all the way!
@AmericanAir calling at 1am to tell me my flight has been rescheduled 12 hours Late Flightr than it was supposed be to seems like a bad solution
@AmericanAir I fail to see how telling a caller that a bag may take ""18 hours"" to get from JFK to Brooklyn is ""the best we can""
@AmericanAir it's not about the weather. It's about the fact that I can't get ahold of anyone to help. BUT you can tweet me back.
@AmericanAir please message me for assistance - can't get through to anyone.
@AmericanAir I've witnessed a manager named Denise yell at 2 different customers with my same issue. #rude
@AmericanAir how comes no one has answered my calls or emails?
@AmericanAir at LAX and your service reps just hand out the 800 number to call. So that's not helpful.
@AmericanAir Extend rtn flight to bereavement, 22nd I could have change fee dropped, now told no.Worse day of my life #badcustomerservice
@AmericanAir I've tried ten times now last night and this morning...how many times should I try? Have meetings to make tonight in ATX.
@AmericanAir  I have still not talked to anyone. You guys should be prepared for these situations. How is this good service? I am so mad!!!
@AmericanAir #horriblecustomerservice # rudestaff # incompetentmanagers
@AmericanAir tisk tisk. Rude flight attendants yet again. I can't hang my suit up because I didn't buy first class? @Delta when will I learn
@AmericanAir that would be appreciated. Just please don't send me to the same page with long form &amp; limited characters.
Direct email?
@AmericanAir this is the biggest joke of #customerservice I've ever seen from a  ✈️ brand http://t.co/XHSUUpHeZe
@AmericanAir it would be awfully nice if you could send an alert when my flight is Cancelled Flighted. No text, no email, no love...
@AmericanAir I understand that, but I'm not even being put on hold - it says ""try again Late Flightr, goodbye"".
@AmericanAir I do not need an apology. I need you to fix it in a competent manner.
@AmericanAir I like the call back system. But thought you'd like to know it's not working well. I received three calls but there's no audio.
@AmericanAir I need to be back home tomorrow and no one is helping me. Please help me rebook for a flight tomorrow!
@AmericanAir Filed a PIR with an agent at Indianapolis airport. Unable to pull up information online on your site. Have DMed details.
@AmericanAir Or u cud answer my ? here! 140 is plenty. Inflight stealing going on right now &amp; FA won't have the uncomfortable convo w pass.
@AmericanAir Fine. Would you have them call me? I left a message, was told it would be 2 hours for a call. Haven't heard anything yet.
@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday early afternoon, so why did you call me at 1230am and 230am to wake me up and tell me?!
@AmericanAir I put a call back in at 1AM and still nothing at 8AM. You think you might get back to me?
@AmericanAir why Cancelled Flight #1605 on 6/25 &amp; 6/28? Flights now 4 hrs longer &amp;  have layovers. Too Late Flight to find a reasonably priced alternative.
@AmericanAir I don't know who that may be. I was also working from home. Thanks for nothing.
@AmericanAir I called the EP line and 4 hours Late Flightr I was called back.  I sat on hold for over a hour to US Airways and then cut off
@AmericanAir my flight 1106 was Cancelled Flightled and I need to get back to Cleveland. What are my options?
@AmericanAir is there any way you could put me up in a hotel for the night?? If not I'm having to sleep at the airport again tonight.
@AmericanAir @MallowFairy And how many times, exactly, should we call and leave our number for a call back? Because that hasn't worked.
.@AmericanAir @C2Next Would be great to get some help too! I've been trying since last night to get through.
@AmericanAir Telling frustrated customers ""we are super busy, please call back Late Flightr kthxbai"" and then hanging up is not the best practice.
@AmericanAir But when becomes about get money from the passengers are very strict but don't have ANY feedback as a reward
@AmericanAir Not even on the bag status...will take actions against this company is incredible how irresponsible are with the costumer
@AmericanAir Still waiting news about my bags 48hrs already happened and this company don't give to the passengers any certain information
@AmericanAir Your customer service sucks! You rep should not be yelling at a caller regarding the weather in DFW.  Hope you go bankrupt!
@AmericanAir Phone just disconnects if you stay on the line. Need to checkout of hotel in 2 hrs &amp; have no place to go. Can't keep calling.
@AmericanAir requested a call back at 1am. My Cancelled Flighted flight through DFW shouldn't take this long to reroute. You're Customer Service lacks
@AmericanAir will you review your systems re notification? The website and telephone systems you have in place are clearly inadequate.
@AmericanAir Why not sell MCE during post door-close shuffle in same way u sell drinks/snacks? People on my flight self-upgraded w/o paying.
@AmericanAir Not good enough. No info communicated at any point - just silence. for hours as we sat. Oh, and then seat was broken. #worst
@AmericanAir I can't get an operator after an hour's worth of calls to Cancelled Flight a delayed flight. Automated system doesn't go beyond message.
@AmericanAir cannot provide us alternative flight until 36 hours Late Flightr ruining our trip! #Cancelled Flightled #angry #problems #ruined.
@AmericanAir Why did I have to stand at baggage claim for an hour waiting for a bag that you knew never made it on to the plane?
@AmericanAir Not very helpful if my flight is already Cancelled Flightled! What about reFlight Booking Problems? AA has my email and cell - yet no notifications.
@AmericanAir now you change my gate and don't tell me? What the fuck is wrong with you people. Learn to do your fucken job
@AmericanAir I would purchase it if I was there by choice but you guys Cancelled Flightled my flight and have me stuck at DFW for 7 hours!
@AmericanAir haha I did. They said it wasn't their fault somehow? You guys r a joke
@AmericanAir Stuck in Miami, and one of the worst customer experiences I have ever had. Will be sure to let everyone know about my time w/AA
@AmericanAir @MurphyJulie it took them 6 hours to call me back. Then it disconnected twice.  I'll never get back to work
@AmericanAir  so far all I am getting is ""maybe your bag will come today. We don't know."" Website says ""status unknown""- can you help?
@AmericanAir My flight 1108 was Cancelled Flightled. I need to be rebooked, and I can't do it online and they aren't answering calls. Help!
@AmericanAir I filled out that whole form before receiving a poor poor response. Is there no direct email address in reply?
@AmericanAir Its the ABC's of PR, let your customers have the most info possible. Might want to go brush up on the basics...
last trip on @AmericanAir ... Poor customer service 3 trips in a row! @Delta here I come!
@AmericanAir stiiiil waiting. Please respond as my flight leaves in 2 1/2 hrs
@AmericanAir you have the worst reps at Jacksonville airport. So rude and totally not helpful at all!
@AmericanAir Understood. Integration takes time, but no excuse for poor customer service
@malhoit at least you got a response from @AmericanAir via Twitter. I went 0 for 2 yesterday.
@AmericanAir I am, called Paris office this morning again, still waiting. It is in Miami but apparently tag was ""taken off""
@AmericanAir Can I get some assistance? Flight Cancelled Flightled (today) from PHX to DFW. Not that I'm hating. But my job is concerned
@AmericanAir wasn't just a delay. Your counter wouldn't take a valid CAC card as a valid ID which is needed for a TSA precheck on pass
@AmericanAir all right, but can you give me an email to write to ?
@AmericanAir I called reservation at 1 am and I'm still waiting for someone to call me back

Hey @AmericanAir why automated call me and then hang up at 4:45 am!?! And why can't I reschedule Cancelled Flighted flights via web!?! Come on!!!

@AmericanAir  help. Flight to Dallas was Cancelled Flightled this morning from cle. on hold for  3 hours. Need to be booked on next flight out.
@AmericanAir me up in a hotel tonight and expect me to now pay even more money. I don't have that money!! I was supposed to get a call back
@AmericanAir my flight 129 to dallas and 259 to SFO has been Cancelled Flighted and they can't get me on anything else until tomorrow. You won't put
@AmericanAir How is it possible that your call system can refuse callers for over twelve hours? What service options does that leave?
@AmericanAir I understand a bit of a wait, but I called at 6:23 pm and didn't get a call back until just after 11:00 pm, that's not cool
@AmericanAir Pathetic answer. Just found out my bag has been sitting at LGA for 20 hours and no call from you to lmk or delivery of bag. BAD
@AmericanAir stranded in Miami because your automated system keeps hanging up on me for two days. Help !
“@AmericanAir: @mwangbickler We apologize for your frustrations, Michael. Have you been rebooked?” -got call back after 10 hours. Bad.

@AmericanAir I am still waiting for that call back. Stranded and no one to talk to
@AmericanAir trying to talk 2 customer service to add lap child and can't get a hold of anybody. I need help!!!!!
@AmericanAir this merger with @USAirways @usairwis a cluster of inefficiency and misinformation.  When is it going to be done?
.@AmericanAir @Kaha58 Would be nice if you could actually talk to the reserv. team...it just hangs up on you and has been since last night.
@AmericanAir why is there only one checkpoint open at JFK terminal 8? Ridiculous.
@AmericanAir wow. Flight crew shows up :15 mins before the flight. No catering for AA3390. Nice. Why to treat your customers.
@AmericanAir.If I miss saying goodbye to my friend cause of your crappy service I swear you will never hear the end of it.#AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir that is absolutely false stmt.  You have a comedy of errors incl no catering etc #GetYourActTogether
@AmericanAir how do I see your report team?
@AmericanAir. It's been 5 hours and still no call and now we are back to being hung up on by an automated system.  #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir you bet make this screw up right (for once). Things I need in bag for my job and you have ""grounded"" me today #painandsuffering
@AmericanAir. All I get is an automated system that hangs up on me. I finally get a message that some will call me back in 2 hours.

@AmericanAir. For two days now I have been trying to reach #AmericanAirlines customer service to change my flight.
@AmericanAir . Death of a dear friend has me heart broken but #AmericanAirlines has me heated!
@AmericanAir spent hour+ trying to check after to use military ID for luggage then messed up boarding pass &amp; forced into line again.
@AmericanAir has no customer service via phone or in person. Just a stone wall with a giant middle finger painted on it.
@AmericanAir 3days and no call,bag or anyone to pick up my call. Held on ph til 130 am and holding again now. Insane,#help
@AmericanAir way to ruin a vacation, my brother has called all night and had multiple places in line only to get dead air on call back
@AmericanAir trying to change my flight and you just hang up on ppl bc call volume is high. That's a joke, right?
@AmericanAir thanks for reFlight Booking Problems me on a flight and then leaving my luggage in NYC. Unbelievable.
@AmericanAir how about a reservation phone system that actually works? You know the 800 number is unreachable? Callbacks are ""dead air"".
@AmericanAir , I was told my flights 2516 &amp; 2244 was Cancelled Flightled. But I don't seem to have any date/time changes. I've been waiting for a call
@AmericanAir husband &amp; I complain about same flight. He gets voucher, I get nothing. Because he flew biz!? Who do I email about this?
@AmericanAir no date on when revieving our money sent a letter in post and several emails no reply?? very frustrated
@AmericanAir you're running 5+ hours behind replying to anyone via Twitter. this is beyond unacceptable. I'm running out of time!
@AmericanAir not sure why we are being made to stand in line outside for plane that isn't ready to board when I could be sitting inside
@AmericanAir even when I did get through, no one knew anything about my bag. This is ridiculous, I still don't have my bag from Saturday.
@AmericanAir thank you Mr Parker for screwing over chairman preferred when we fly AA. No #firstclass option and treated like crap by staff
@AmericanAir thinks it's a good cs to get everyone through the gate for flight 4275 then we wait bc plane not ready http://t.co/rxmjWoo7Qi

@AmericanAir got call saying flight Cancelled Flightled but checked online and it isn't Cancelled Flightled. No where near bad weather. I have job interview
@AmericanAir #worstcustservice you should have contingency plans for extra workers during bad weather. 4+ hours hold #ridiculous
@AmericanAir Please stop changing my flights for Spring Break. This is the 5th time!
@AmericanAir a school trip of 38 including myself had to sleep over in the airport and are all on different standby flights.This is not good
@AmericanAir your customer service is inferior to that of a nationalized third world nation's airline. Get it together.
@AmericanAir not only did you Cancelled Flight our flight from JFK and delay us by 29 hours, you've now lost 2 of our bags. Worst airline ever.
@AmericanAir just want to thank you guys for the 27 hour delay for flight AA106 from JFK due to staff shortage and not weather✈️
@AmericanAir you delayed me for 15 hours in Chicago and still managed to lose my bag! Really not happy
@AmericanAir Your rubbish at Social Media! In the air two hours Late Flight but that's better than being Cancelled Flightled!
@AmericanAir yes but you did manage to lose two of our bags. Horrendous airline.
@AmericanAir 953 our  fligth Somthing to talk  about this?
@AmericanAir interested in possibly changing my flight to another day...need to see if there are any fees but your number is busy
@AmericanAir I understand you are busy but I have still gotten no answer. I need to get home and you guys have not helped at all
@AmericanAir been on hold for for over two hours. After waiting 2 hours earlier. Can't get any info on my reservation. How is that ok?
@AmericanAir @nickcunningham1 Except now there is no wait time, the phone system just hangs up on you. So continuing to hold won't help.
@AmericanAir LGA already by the time we pulled from the flight. QQBMUG. feel free to look up how many flights we've been ""reticketed"" on.
@AmericanAir @loganex except if you call now you'll get the same message. Trust me, I've tried.
@AmericanAir westjet and your rep won't do anything about my lost luggage- which I never even checked with westjet because it was lost in
@AmericanAir waited in the airport for two days to get home, not weather reLate Flightd. Dealt with horrible customer service. Finally switched to
@AmericanAir are you ignoring me on purpose? It was sad enough having your automated system hang up on me 
@AmericanAir who do I need to talk to to get a full refund on my trip? Your call center offers no assistance.
@AmericanAir why wont you find my luggage without blaming everyone else?
@AmericanAir that all AA is for USAir Elite members. It's one big disappointment in the way we are treated. #epicfailure
@AmericanAir love how you can't get an agent on the phone and the automated system hangs up on you
@AmericanAir I was just called abt my flight Cancelled Flightlation- a flight that was Cancelled Flightled at 10:30a Sunday. Two 4:00a calls are not okay.
@AmericanAir Thank you for the worst experience ever on an airline, from me to you, I hope your embarrassed as an airline. Pathetic
@AmericanAir @British_Airways 2 weeks ago today i arrived in miami and I still don't have my bag, absolute disgrace!
@AmericanAir so am I going to be homeless or do I have a place to stay tonight? Can you respond to me here so I can go back to sleep?
@AmericanAir at 5 am and have no clue if we have a place to stay or not
@AmericanAir but really, can you DM me on here to verify if you've booked a hotel for our extra night here? Kinda unsettling to get a call
@AmericanAir @emeyerson @ggreenwald Don't wait on a bag. Go to Walmart and get what you need for tomorrow morning.
@AmericanAir been calling 2 different offices already and still no sign of my baggage. First time on American Air.. (6)
@AmericanAir @Cowboycerrone You apologise for HIS frustrations &amp; HIS disappointment but NOT your terrible service? #BlameShiftOverload
@AmericanAir Got it worked out. Had to postpone my trip and pay extra though. :/ Not easy for a poor graduate student.
@AmericanAir I don't want to waste any more of my time on your airline (you've already robbed 21 hours of my day) but I definitely will.
@AmericanAir i've now been in France two days without changing clothes and nothing to keep me warm so please locate my bag and send it to(4)

@AmericanAir Hands down the worst airline to travel with. Really really fucking bad.
@AmericanAir is the 24/7 phone line open? On hold for over 2 hours now. Your check-in agents cannot help at the airport itself. Please help.
@AmericanAir what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs
@AmericanAir No it isn't -  sheer incompetence was reigning at DFW today. I was there. On a plane on the GD runway. I doubt you were.
@AmericanAir still waiting on a dm response..... #sloooowresponses
@AmericanAir @robinreda that can be a stop over before Paris. You are an embarrassment
@AmericanAir @robinreda being stuck two days in the airport is not something pretty normal. I am positive you can find a plane to Europe
@AmericanAir highly disappointed in the baggage service with this merge with @USAirways you guys have lost our 1st bag and now missing items
@AmericanAir just landed - 3hours Late Flight - and now we need to wait TWENTY MORE MINUTES for a gate!  I have patience but none for incompetence.
@AmericanAir FINALLY called me back... BUT HASN'T SPOKEN TO ME.  Like the worst prank call EVER!!
@AmericanAir wait times of 2 hours to talk with an exec plt agent, what is going on!!!
@AmericanAir so the one time we upgrade to first class our luggage was open and now missing valuable items that can't be replaced. #upset

@AmericanAir has to be the worst airline in the world #yousuck #horrible #Oscars2015
.@AmericanAir @USAirways Add insult to injury you guys ""misplaced"" my bag. 
Can't believe you have to pay money to be treated this poorly.

@AmericanAir why arent callings going thru it doesnt have me wait or anything and automated stuff is messed up
@AmericanAir we will not be flying with you or US air again. The changes and Cancelled Flightations leading up to today's big finale is unacceptable.
@AmericanAir thanks for your apology but it's a bit Late Flight. Cancelled Flighting a flight more than 24 hrs in advance due to weather is ridiculous. We
@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight tomorrow (without telling me) and I want to rebook-please help me book a new flight! What # can I call?
@AmericanAir The word failure means: an act or instance of failing or proving unsuccessful; lack of success nonperformance of something due.
@AmericanAir Why offer automated call back option when agent is available only to call me &amp; have me sit on hold? At 12:30am. #onholdfordays
@AmericanAir - Hanging up on customers with no chance for a callback is a failure of customer service. 1:30am EST and no one can answer? 2/2
@AmericanAir To think that I'm a ""Priority Member""! Wonder how you treat the plebes. I know which rewards card I'm Cancelled Flightling immediately.
@AmericanAir - for the past 5.5 hours, call volume is so high that no one can take my call to Cancelled Flight my itinerary? #YoureDoingItWrong 1/2
@AmericanAir Worst airline. You Cancelled Flight flight, don't let me know, I wait on hold 30 mins, told to enter callback for middle of the night?!!
@AmericanAir  Did you guys just give up helping people? Your phone tree just hangs up on me and I have a flight tomorrow. Connection pending
@AmericanAir you called back just to put me on hold. It's midnight. Literally just want to know how I'm getting home and I'm getting no help
@AmericanAir Flight #2390 delayed 14 hours!! No one at #AmericanAirlines counter can tell my husband that he will be on that flight! Help???
@AmericanAir this has happens so many times. It's just upsetting to see how poorly an airline treats their customers
@AmericanAir seriously, there aren't any reps available to take phone calls? Even for platinum?
@AmericanAir overall lack of attention or foresight when managing flights.
@AmericanAir now we are all stuck on the plane after landing because crew unable to figure it out
@AmericanAir Also, been on hold for 30 minutes with your ""customer service"" to find out when my new flight is scheduled bc your site SUCKS
@AmericanAir Yes and without my bags. 2 first class tickets to Tahiti would be nice. Just saying
@AmericanAir Err 2 hour wait time for the Exec. Plat. line?

@AmericanAir bag turned up, no thanks to your useless call-centre and useless website
@AmericanAir I understand the weather issues. I don't understand how I was not notified of the Cancelled Flightlation, and had to realize it so Late Flight.
@AmericanAir why won't u deliver my luggage? Almost two days and holding on the phone for over 4 hrs. Help!
@AmericanAir  you have now lost my luggage for40 hours holding for4 hrs on phone #wtf is this how you treat your loyal passengers?#stranded
@AmericanAir have been waiting over THREE hours to talk to someone to rebook a flight due to weather. does call back service actually work??
@AmericanAir the service received by both of us was rude and well below my expectations of your airline. That is what's most frustrating
@AmericanAir please DM me a way to get in touch with someone that can help. I'm platinum AA and considering quitting AA BC of this.
@AmericanAir it was my friend. She shouldn't have been scheduled so close together at LAX then not reimbursed. It's costing her 12 hrs &amp;$250
@AmericanAir sounding like they just got bitch-slapped by @juliasinton948
@AmericanAir I've been on hold with international award reservations for almost 2 hours. 800-433-7300 keeps calling me. what is going on?
@AmericanAir can someone actually either call back or help me figure out how I'm getting home??!
@AmericanAir How is hanging up on customers because of ""high volume"" customer service? Tried to resolve via DM-still waiting.So bad. #aafail
@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, website refers to 1-800#, the 1-800# hangs up on me. Not auto-rebooked. Really? Horrible company.
@AmericanAir We have been sitting on this bird #AA1457 for 2 hrs on the dfw tarmac.  Some water would be nice.  Where's your manners?
@AmericanAir I need to know what to do? My flight has been Cancelled Flightled and I can't speak to anyone. Help!
@americanair been calling your for 4+ hours to reschedule a flight to #DFW due to weather and your won't even let me stay on hold.....
@AmericanAir your customer service is a disgrace.
@AmericanAir first flight is Cancelled Flightled. Been on hold for 4 hours. Need information and getting none. Help?
@AmericanAir Get a new crystal ball. Cancelled Flight flights before weather hits to rebook me on flight during? Looking like 2 nights hotel on me.
@AmericanAir yes. Shows Cancelled Flightled &amp; asks for her to contact you at 800 number.
@AmericanAir Toby hates you lol
@AmericanAir what I am put off by is the fact that no gate supervisor has tried to come by and communicate with us.
@AmericanAir Need to change flight, but the CS # is telling me it can't take my call. Can't change online. Please help. Flight is this week.
@AmericanAir lies,lies,lies.  Worst travel experience of my life. Day 2 no clothes on vaca.  #lostluggage #unprofessional #pit #mia
@AmericanAir @ArminRosen @ggreenwald Tell that piece of shit to get fucked... I'll fly exclusively with you for life...
@AmericanAir I have ""continued contacting"" your phone reps for 7 hours and am still unable to get through. That's absurd and I am livid.
@AmericanAir I have almost 3 million miles w u so I am loyal to u.  When r u going to reciprocate?  What a joke
@AmericanAir Thank you for holding, we apologize for the delay in answering your call. To speak to a representative please continue to hold.
@AmericanAir Weather was not involved.
@AmericanAir @dogbuckeye No, I was on hold for 4 1/2 hours.  3 diff agents each w/ different information, frustrating, kept getting txfd...
@AmericanAir I'm still on hold if you're wondering...  4 hours 37 minutes and counting.  #ServiceFail #OnHoldForever #Suboptimal
@AmericanAir I have never seen such incompetency from a gate agent in years of business travel DFW B16 gate agent needs training or new job
@AmericanAir Hey you Cancelled Flightled my flight, and I can't get someone on the phone to rebook (2 hour wait minimum). Can I get some service?
@AmericanAir our ft 1261 TUS/DFW (w/cx to LGA) tomorrow Cancelled Flighted,  4 hrs so far waiting for call back. What should we do? Need to get to nyc
@AmericanAir @USAirways and our meals are also on us, because this company does not care about their #customers. Truly disgraceful.
@AmericanAir by far the best example of the worst company @Cowboycerrone
@AmericanAir @USAirways cost me a day of vacation ($350 hotel stay), day of dog boarding, and a day of airport parking.
@AmericanAir @USAirways and the way I have been spoken to by #DFW and #Mia employees is truly disgusting. Save the pain fly with anyone else
@AmericanAir I'm home &amp; only 9hr Late Flight.  No thanks to your service centre - their plan involved 4 flight legs all across NA and 2 full days..
@AmericanAir thx for losing my bag. How hard is it to care for a bag w PRIORITY on it?why do u cont to not care for EP's?
@AmericanAir to my destination. After waiting 2 hours and missing our second flight with them. Our #luggage made the flight though...
@AmericanAir that luggage you forgot...#mia.....he just won an oscar
@AmericanAir cost me 1 day of #vacation ($350) and all I got was a rude woman tell me to go to another country and figure out how to get...
@AmericanAir You should really help @Cowboycerrone out, you are getting a TON of bad publicity right now #WillNeverFlyWithYou
@AmericanAir lost @LeslieWolfson luggage on flight yesterday morning #Miami to #NewYork #LGA no response and no luggage more than 37 hrs ltr
@AmericanAir By ""answering as fast as they can"", you mean hanging up on every call?
@AmericanAir but at least your automated message gives me info about your merger w/ @USAirways. Another airline I know to avoid.
@AmericanAir that 2 hr wait became a 4 hr one. And y'all claimed to have sent an email. Yeah, that never happened. #FlyDelta
@AmericanAir it's been 2 hrs of wait on the phone a) worst customer services b) trying to know where my suitcase Is and way MORE #ANGRY
@AmericanAir why don't you take care of @Cowboycerrone flight screw ups
@AmericanAir wht n  experience w/aa reservations #service Tried to be patient with rep and she just disconnects me aa do u record conv.?
@AmericanAir Any info for Cancelled Flightled flight 1046 tomorrow morning out of DFW? Can't get calls through to speak with anyone.
@AmericanAir ticks me off.
@AmericanAir today, after 6 yrs., no longer my preferred airline.
@AmericanAir - Appreciate your system is busy but when I call, having your automated system hang up on me is not helpful.
@AmericanAir next time my flight's Cancelled Flightled, I'd appreciate SOME indication (email, text, carrier pigeon). App didn't even warn at check in
@AmericanAir - I am Platinum.  I am flying USAir and they have stranded me in CLT.  Not answering phones. Did not rebook me.  Please help?
@AmericanAir is AA951 to São Paulo taking off today? Your colleagues won't tell us any thing
@AmericanAir you can't change my flights and not have enough operators to handle calls.... #unacceptable #AmericanAirlines
.@AmericanAir Flight 654 Delayed / Flight 409 You sold my seat / flight 0671 strand me in PHX for three hours. Thanks for the memories 
@AmericanAir I paid extra $ for my seat &amp; the monitor didn't work from on AA111. How about a refund on the seat? Conf #: MDBEEI, McMullen
@AmericanAir how nice it would be if you had helpful flight attendants instead of the rude nasty ones you employ. #WhyAreYouYelling
@AmericanAir Yes. However, the seats they assign us that day are never together. I just want to sit with my husband! Why is that impossible?
@americanair line of 100+ people to rebook at MIA now. Virtual hold on rebook line just hangs up during call back. http://t.co/Upaz1eF3Dl
@AmericanAir found out my flight tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled &amp; got in the queue for a callback 3.5 hours ago…still nothing. Can I get rebooked??
@AmericanAir Thanks for your canned response that makes it look like you care about your customers. I'm sure all Twitter users fall for it..
@AmericanAir is the new @SpiritAirlines, and both are worse than taking the @GreyhoundBus #americanairlines #nocustomerservice #fail
@AmericanAir what are the odds my bag was picked up by someone not me while in another country? Because it says it hasn't been located yet.
@AmericanAir better do the right thing and take care of @Cowboycerrone or els you're losing business!!!!
@AmericanAir have been waiting for a call back for over two hours jan to die tomorrow at 6am Cancelled Flightled what are my options?
@AmericanAir one staff on desk. Now been queuing for over an hr.
@AmericanAir and even worse, by the time you responded to my tweets I took two flights over five hours. And that was the quickest response!
@AmericanAir on top of that my online record was unavailable as well and then couldn't get anyone on the phone.
@AmericanAir My ex-boyfriend picks up my calls more than you do! #Cancelled Flightedflight #nocustomerservice #americanairlines #FAIL
@AmericanAir why are you still selling tickets when you haven't rebooked people to arrive at their destinations on time?
@AmericanAir @ti2469 oh shiz i'm only 40 minutes into my wait after the first 3 hour barrier ...unbelievable
@AmericanAir wow @AmericanAir still screw n stuff up
@AmericanAir I just checked the app and it said my flight had been moved back a day? No explanations why. No answer on the 800 number.
@AmericanAir employees are racist!!!!!
@AmericanAir this is pathetic customer service. Why have bag tags, barcodes and computers if your response is, ""not yet located""?
@AmericanAir i hope it takes you 6 hours to get home when it should take 20. my flight was Cancelled Flightled because they ""couldn't staff the plane""
@AmericanAir I need to speak to a REAL PERSON. My flight was Cancelled Flightled with no explanation, and I've been on hold for more than 3 hours.
@AmericanAir you have let me down. Seriously. #unhappycustomer
@AmericanAir @DuaneNClark  ever think about being prepared and bringing in more people? Does anyone have any business sense at AA?
@AmericanAir why do I have to wait for 2 hours to talk to someone when you changed my flight?
@AmericanAir due to gate agents I missed my connecting flight to Mexico City...not a happy customer AA- let's correct this
@AmericanAir at some point u need to tell passengers what is going on. At Jfk waiting to get on flight it is a mess.
@AmericanAir its not that, it's the rude agent who wouldn't listen to anything I would say and it clearly fit into the sizer
@AmericanAir seriously, I do not want to wait 24 hours for a flight when I have to prepare for a family funeral.
@AmericanAir your gate agents at DFW gate B16 are pathetic tonight.  Terrible communication, stories changing and apathetic
@AmericanAir I was worried when my bag went SAN to DCA 24 hours before me. But our reunion was an organized  breeze! http://t.co/uOARyQ98PU
@AmericanAir I've been tryin to use my voucher to book a flight the last 2days. Lines are busy. Plse help me?The flight may go up.
@AmericanAir  is the worst airline to ever travel with!!!! The worst!! They're equivalent to DIRT!!!!!!
@AmericanAir pretty bad at #DFW no updates two flights behind doors open breeze no America airlines workers http://t.co/6MBK79mdnW
@AmericanAir yes and the auto rebook confirmed an outbound that departs after the return flight.  # fire the software programmers
@AmericanAir I'm getting calls from 1-800-433-7300 but the calls seem to drop instantly. Is there any alternate avenue for resched. support?
@AmericanAir Supposed to arrive at my destination tonight. American rebooks me for Wednesday? Where am I staying until then?
@AmericanAir @USAirways how can you have no food on a 4 hour flight 528 from Columbus to Phoenix? Starving and Pissed off. Can't eat Go Go!
@AmericanAir jal and cathay pacific so no, I can't do it online.
@AmericanAir 4828 but I just missed it because no one is at the gate to marshall us in so now I have to rent a car &amp; drive 5 hrs. So thanks.
@AmericanAir The pilot told us they would release bags as well as offer hotel vouchers. Neither happened.
@AmericanAir my understanding is they were able and did for many other flights but chose not to for this one.
@AmericanAir Hey so I'm very disappointed with my time traveling with you! I've had the worst experience and both times the flight delayed!
@AmericanAir  having trouble getting rebooked
@AmericanAir I'm willing to hold for an agent. you aren't being helpful you keep hanging up on me #americanairsucks #hiremorepoeple
@AmericanAir I have been trying to speak with an agent the whole day about my Cancelled Flightled flight, what I can do?
@AmericanAir Need to go frm TPA to MCI tmrw &amp; my connection thru DFW is Cancelled Flightled. Can u connect me thru a diff city? Been on hold for 2 hrs
@AmericanAir no gate agent after 30 minutes to let us off the plane???? WTW / grounds crew is here / hope you're ready to cover my delay
@AmericanAir You can't even get someone on the phone. Great story for the media.
“@AmericanAir:  ""Jason, you'll end up missing your connection. Please see our DFW agents for assistance.” Nope! Hasn't taken off yet, still!
@AmericanAir finally made it to chicago - 13 hours Late Flight.  Did get a $12 food voucher for my wait.about $1per/hr. Never again. Good bye.
@AmericanAir instead of putting the burden on your customers do the right thing and get more gate agents.
@AmericanAir guys 5350 in dfw  stuck at the gate for half an hour.  Do we pull the slide or what?
@AmericanAir plz kys I have been sitting in this plane for an hour I want to leave
@AmericanAir after all that weve been through today as a courtesy to not allow a passenger with an oxgen tank sit up there is bad business
@AmericanAir Now you've Cancelled Flightled my flight. First a priority ticket bumped and now this. You're losing customers. People are furious.
@AmericanAir it that you say is going to help us? Give me a number to call that isn't a recording w a 2 hour wait time!
@AmericanAir no you're not you're trying to book me PAST when i need 2 arrive but you're still selling seats on the day I'm trying 2 travel
@AmericanAir because you won't get our bags for us because you said they would go on to Cincinnati even though we can't. Who exactly is
@AmericanAir you all should really be ashamed. The entire business class cabin is empty and almost all of first class...
@AmericanAir You could only get us on a flight 30 minutes before the funeral starts. We're stranded in Dallas w/o luggage for 2 days
@AmericanAir just Cancelled Flightled my 7 am flight tomorrow with out informing me at all today, then booked one in 2 days, and no customer service
@AmericanAir we knew it was not going to leave but we had 6 hours waiting... that was the hurry..
@AmericanAir we tried. We are headed to a funeral in Cincinnati and your people didn't even tell us we could get on standby.
@AmericanAir they don't even give an option to hold.. Just say lines are busy Plz try Late Flightr
@AmericanAir i will be writing a very detailed letter to you all about this experience today. I have never experienced such awful cs ever
@AmericanAir The delay is nothing but the personnel being so combative up to the point of saying ""what's the hury,  the plane is not leaving
@AmericanAir delta rerouted 6 of my bags onto aa977 MIA-CUR. How can I see if they made it onto the flight?
@AmericanAir would have been nice if the agents were at the very least courteous since the delay was AA's fault
@AmericanAir no private msg me and will provide details...u really need customer svc training for your staff
@AmericanAir you guys should really improve the service experience with your on site personnel. This has been one of the worst experiences.
@AmericanAir @Expedia are killing me. Over 3 hours to get NO human to help me.
@AmericanAir 1 ticket agent servicing at least 60 people on line. Waiting for an hour and a half and your phones hang up on people.
@AmericanAir yeah, rebooked for tomorrow morning. But extremely disappointed to miss a wedding.
@AmericanAir thanks for the call on my Cancelled Flightled flight, NOT!  Flight Booking Problems me for Tues no good weather caused me 2 leave early
@AmericanAir on plane for JFK-&gt;SFO, been sitting here for 1.5 hours waiting for push crew, how is this acceptable?
@AmericanAir waiting for you to pick up... Coming up on 3 hours now... http://t.co/nOPq5xIsbS
@AmericanAir hey flight 5350 in dfw stuck at gate with no gate agent.  Plane full of people missing connections.
@AmericanAir so we've now been driving across DFW for over 90mins. That's half fucking way to Texarkana! #shouldhavedriven
@AmericanAir can you tell me why all flights from XNA 2 DFW are Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow morning already?
@AmericanAir pathetic service
@AmericanAir oh it can get better apparently. After making us wait for a gate, psych!! Now we need you to de-ice before coming to the gate!!
@AmericanAir I know you can't control weather but you can control how you treat customers..#shafted
@AmericanAir I have tried to talk to someone for almost 6 hrs! you Cancelled Flightled my flight and you won't pick up the phone. pathetic &amp; very sad
@AmericanAir several hrs Late Flight and 140 characters won't do it. Cheers though
@AmericanAir my wife's flight is Cancelled Flightled, told to call. No one answers. How do we book a flight? Help us please
@AmericanAir not in any way that I am happy with or find acceptable.   If I could speak to a human maybe that would happen
@AmericanAir hi my flight to DFW 2463 was Cancelled Flightled tonight. Called in and left my number for call back it's been 3hrs please help.
@AmericanAir - where are my bags? Baggage claim C25 or C26 (flt# 959)?? I can see the plane from here? Why does it take 25 min???
@AmericanAir is there only one call centre? I know it's busy right now, really need to speak to agent not computer
@AmericanAir you guys fail again.. all I need to do is use my voucher for a ticket but I can't do it online #yourphonesystemsucks
@AmericanAir we've been on hold for over 4 hrs, you Cancelled Flighted flt 2222 phl-dfw. Need assistance!!!
@AmericanAir their flights into Buffalo as well -- You were the only flight Cancelled Flightled!!!
@AmericanAir -- This is after you Cancelled Flightled our flight into Buffalo because of ""weather"" and lied to us and said other airlines Cancelled Flightled
@AmericanAir dropping the ball. Again. No catering. Plane switch. No gate attendant. 2 hours Late Flight. Really nice.
@AmericanAir ""We'll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight"" is ridiculous.
@AmericanAir You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight, people need their undies the next morning!
@AmericanAir gotta be worse than @delta w/ on time departures.  I rushed back to terminal C for 8:25 flight but they haven't strtd boarding.
@AmericanAir was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they're not and I continue to be lied to.
@AmericanAir won't answer the reservation line!  Nice service.  We may be stuck...
@AmericanAir It's not your agents; it's your voice activated system that's not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems
@AmericanAir no other (what should be valid) Circle Pacific itineraries can be booked either - always makes all US dest. invalid 4 last leg
@AmericanAir I am trying to add my tsa pre check number to my reservation online and don't see an option to do that..?? #nosecuritylines
@AmericanAir you have the poorest trained employees at these desks. I haven't even started to discuss the #lostluggage yet
@AmericanAir none of your sample itineraries can actually be booked http://t.co/mF7rABGn8a Every last leg back to US says invalid
@AmericanAir what happened?? We didn't get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone
@AmericanAir @derekc21 , to my surprise  BA doesn't  have  me registered in the system , I was getting hopeful :(, Lets step it up , Okay ?
@AmericanAir Unfortunately that is not true. A robot apologizes and hangs up. So how do I get help?
@AmericanAir aa223 being ignored
@AmericanAir FYI twice now I've tried the ""we'll call you when someone is free"" thing. Both times it called, I picked up, then it hung up.
@AmericanAir that's the number I called -it wouldn't let me speak to an agent because of the issues with weather today
@AmericanAir usually raving about the service to LAX. Your nbr1 and helper can't figure out how to hang a coat and serve a drink. 6F
@AmericanAir @MO3TVida just so you know, reservations team has a 2+ hr callback time
@AmericanAir absolute terrible service to schedule a 40 minute layover and then not let someone on the plane with the door not closed.
@AmericanAir I really want to get home. Tonight, preferably. Please stop delaying my plane  #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir is profiting in the billions and throwing crap at the people who put them there. American is a hurting brand
@AmericanAir I've never witnessed such covert tactics from an airline.
@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my wife's flight and she has to call but your service won't even let us. Going on 7 hours now.
@AmericanAir it shouldn't happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. What steps do you take to protect customers if their items
@AmericanAir all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. These  issues are based on negligence.
@AmericanAir the worst air experience I have ever had and I am not in the first plane yet.
@AmericanAir so we have a Cancelled Flightled flight in about twelve hours. Maybe we'll have heard from an AA rep at that point.
@AmericanAir on hold for 3 hours...got an agent, immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 min, 80 min Late Flightr, waiting
@AmericanAir @CineDrones I just wish that a team member would pick up the phone at this point, let alone be courteous or helpful 
@americanair seriously, pls pls bring more people up to help us! There are still flights to ORD frm DFW and I want in http://t.co/o3CjsVSsqF
@AmericanAir @carlw1980 I have followed and dm'd you. . . Please respond to my concern too. Really disappointed with customer service.
@AmericanAir  To add, I have to get up to go to work tomorrow am.  I don't like having to wait up until 12 or Late Flightr.  CS sucks.
@AmericanAir just when I thought you guys were done messing up, you make it worse. Your airline ruins hopes and dreams.
@AmericanAir approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on #AmericanAirlines flight 3056 - Oscar performance
@AmericanAir - We have; they were useless. Baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. Now, maybe midnight.
@AmericanAir AA 2258 why have you Cancelled Flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives?  Very poor.
@AmericanAir how have you not loaded our luggage on the plane and were OVER an hour delayed? #Flight293
@AmericanAir I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on @united for $382 but their mileage program sucks.
@americanair Plz bring more agents up to DFW AA Cstmr srvc ctr gates A, there are only 2 agents and 100+ ppl... http://t.co/uCvEU2hurZ
@AmericanAir the food served on AA2402 was vile and gross.The entire cabin did not eat their meal. Survey the flight crew. Another gross out
@AmericanAir never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice
@AmericanAir my #Navy sisters flight 2470 cancld. She can't get an agent. They've called her back to be put on hold &amp; then discnct.Any help?
@americanair anxious to see how you all care for customers you’ve inconvenienced #Cancelled Flightledflight
@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy.
@AmericanAir Why can't you handle your customers needs? Cancelled Flightled flight, 800 number leads to a quick ""Goodbye"" Very Sad!
@AmericanAir VERY upset that I cannot select seats for Tuesday flight online or over the phone. Terrible customer service :( Please help!
@AmericanAir already did &amp; an automated voice told us to wait 2 hours. They have yet to call back.
@AmericanAir you changed my AAdvantage travel plans &amp; I called 800-433-7300 to get help but it sea ur too busy &amp; hangs up on me. What gives?
@AmericanAir yes, for tomorrow at 9 am. But I have to work though  I'm really mad about the situation
@AmericanAir whenever I cheat on you it goes horribly wrong! I promise, I won't stray anymore. I'm talking about you @Delta!
@AmericanAir @praywinn between understaffing, what looks like a labor slowdown, weather, incompetence, and disregard for the customer...
@AmericanAir I need help with a reservation purchased on @AmericanAir but operated on @USAirways, can't get through on the 800#
@AmericanAir  flight from DFW to LIT tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled.  What do I do next?  Pls advise.  #HELP
@AmericanAir how can you not be taking calls? I need to change my flight!
@AmericanAir it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.
@AmericanAir ""overweight"" flight = you sold more tickets than you had seats. We all know that. Let's call it what it is.
@AmericanAir at JFK flight to Boston delayed 20 min waiting for catering they are boarding flight to LAX waiting for over and hour WTF?
@AmericanAir Yes, it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. Also I never got an email from AA saying my flight was Cancelled Flightled.
@AmericanAir Can you help with my Cancelled Flightled flight -- I'd like to book another flight...I've been on hold for 95 minutes and counting....
@AmericanAir been waiting on hold for more than an hour
@AmericanAir thanks. Now my carry on that you guys insisted be checked at the gate is missing. Won't be here till Late Flight tomorrow morning.
@AmericanAir spoke too soon. 30 min Late Flightr still waiting for bags to load. Some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least.
@AmericanAir Been trying to call all day, get hung up on every time. Your guys are horrible!
@AmericanAir @jameswester see, James, we only have 7 dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits
@AmericanAir , sitting on plane for 2.5hrs at gate due to computer sys issue, at what point do you Cancelled Flight a flight?, ridiculous @PHLAirport
@AmericanAir @cjdjpdx not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. Stop understaffing!
@AmericanAir @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can't staff a call center
Is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at @AmericanAir ? Been waiting 28hrs and still haven't even seen one plane
@AmericanAir AA919 flight attendant freaks out and leaves aircraft as passengers react to a 24h delay and cattle treatment. Surreal!
@AmericanAir a worker just checked for ice on our plane using his cell phone flashlight! Really?! Come on!
@AmericanAir The wine served in USAirways flights are watered down somehow right out of the bottles.
@AmericanAir @PatrichRuben no, profit maximization is your top priority. Nothing else even registers for you dinosaurs
@AmericanAir #flight293 was supposed to depart at 745 and at 815 we still have not boarded.
@AmericanAir You have the worst customer service of any airlines I've ever encountered. Flat out awful
@AmericanAir @ezemanalyst why don't you tweet canned, impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer you've got
@AmericanAir then taxi across dfw airport for 20 min to then state 75 min past departing from gate that we need deiced? Wow. Uncool &amp; untrue
@AmericanAir 24 hrs &amp; 2 cncld flights Late Flightr I've landed in PHL. Now 30 mins &amp; counting on tarmac waiting for gate. Pls do better than this.
@AmericanAir delivered mom's delayed bag to the wrong place. 2 hrs on hold yesterday, &gt;1 hr today. Still no bag. #AA http://t.co/QKkJdFObOS
@AmericanAir this is awful customer service.
@AmericanAir its pulling away from gate to get your departure time then leaving us on tarmac claiming power issues that magically repaired
@AmericanAir @sarahzou translation: we don't reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. 'Cause we don't care.
@AmericanAir OMG ANSWER YOUR PHONE I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR 1.5 hours. Cancelled FlightED FLIGHTS SUCK
@AmericanAir we are through. I can quit you. I am. The nonsense &amp; lies are a colossal infringement you can no longer get away with
@AmericanAir @JimDayTV no, you couldn't care less. That's why their customer service is run by bots
@AmericanAir pls tell me how to get a person on the phone asap
@AmericanAir I have a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! Please! I just want to go home!
@AmericanAir yes but we HAVE TO GET HOME TOMORROW!!!! Please
@AmericanAir unfriendly unhelpful agents. Unannounced gate changes. Delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth
@AmericanAir flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded
@AmericanAir we need a miracle @slcairport please help flight 1228 get out of here by 640 #FingersCrossed #pleasegod #missmykids
@AmericanAir i do not want to stay overnight at this airport! I have been here since 11 am this morning!
@AmericanAir Trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare.  I was hung up on once. Can you help me rebook?
@AmericanAir i have tried getting help from agents, the phone, twitter, and FB. Can no one at American Airlines help me?
@AmericanAir Close down
@AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.
@AmericanAir I’ve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again.
@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it
@AmericanAir I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable.
@AmericanAir now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone
@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
@AmericanAir I did 50 times and no one was helpful I'm missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn't want to talk us
@AmericanAir My flight to @dfwairport was Cancelled Flightled. Mess ensued. Please thank the awesome Marcos (Concierge Key @ GRU) for sorting it out!
@AmericanAir I haven't been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven't heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :(
@AmericanAir not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting....
@AmericanAir I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI  is taking. I know it's US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home.
@AmericanAir Same as yesterday's Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful!
@AmericanAir big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. Hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here.  Thanks again for a sleepless night.
@AmericanAir really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles
@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!
@AmericanAir tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool.
@AmericanAir all flights Cancelled Flighted tomorrow and that means I'm stranded at the airport for the night... wow.
@AmericanAir how hard is it to have catering ready to go?
@AmericanAir Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option?
@AmericanAir this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day.
@AmericanAir I made my flight but then still had no update emails when I landed, no info ever sent on that or second flight. Losing my biz.
@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded - still waiting
@AmericanAir I still am not on a flight. Ive been here allll day and now we're not boarding because we're waiting for catering?
@AmericanAir my husband and 5 year old son stuck overnight in DC thanks to 7 crew members arguing over who was boarding the flight
@AmericanAir if this is how you guys work then i will never fly with you guys again.
@AmericanAir agents refuse to help, ""too busy"" &amp; need to call advantage#. NO ONE willing to help and apparently being exec plat means ZERO
@AmericanAir fight got Cancelled Flighted can u help me rebook a flight?  Call center is too busy to answer calls or even put me on hold #yuck
@AmericanAir ah if only we could get through. We've tried for over 2 hrs. Can we call @united?
@AmericanAir this is ridiculous! You all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced.
@AmericanAir of course it wasn't your intention, issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly; she sat on hold for 50 mins
@AmericanAir I have been waiting at this airport since 11 am and have to wait until 8:30 tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help!
@AmericanAir pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault
@AmericanAir trying to check in for flight. On line not working &amp; agents too busy to take my call.
@AmericanAir understand the weather but would be nice to hear an apology on the phone when you moved my flight to an inconvenient day
@AmericanAir My baggage is lost, my flight Cancelled Flightled and i get no accommodations? Not even to another airline. At least one free hotel?
@AmericanAir I've been on hold for about 3 and a half hours now. Thanks for Cancelled Flighting my flight and not notifying me.
@AmericanAir rude gate agent by AA363 ORD-LGA just now. Seems to have a temper. Made me check in a bag that fit INSIDE the sizer.
@AmericanAir you put a sour taste on this customer’s vacation. it was joke watching those “we care thanks for choosing us” videos
@AmericanAir help us here !!! We are stuck here @jfk for more than 24hours! !we need to go home #flight919 #saveus
@AmericanAir lets me get in line for call back in over 2 hours. I'll just hope the 1 ticket left on the flight I want is still there Late Flightr.
@AmericanAir Flight  AA1691 LAX to LAS closes too early and gate agents give us hassles #PatheticCX
@AmericanAir I am honestly in shock how this process and service compares to my other airline experiences. Not really sure what to say...
@AmericanAir here we go again #aa106 ""Plane not ready"". Are we going to find the crew run out of time again like last night #shortstaffed
@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded
@AmericanAir why does your customer service line say ""we are experiencing high call volume"" and then spontaneously hangup on the person?
@AmericanAir well its been over 4 hours now and still no one has picked up   try paying overtime and bring in more people
@AmericanAir pleaseeee find my suitcase. I want deoderant and a clean shirt for work tomorrow :(
@AmericanAir any idea what's up with flight AA3181?
@AmericanAir your maint delay left us stuck in den!! Flight 1080.  Been on plane for 7 hrs.  Stop flying broke french planes!
@AmericanAir  You can't get us to Cincy but our luggage will still go there tonight? Stranded us in Dallas for 2 days w/o clothes? #Yousuck
@AmericanAir It just hangs up and your agents on the ground are useless. How don't I have a seat on a first class ticket booked weeks ago?
@AmericanAir ive literally been holding for more than 2 HOURS now. i was told 2hrs. You all are sabotaging any chance i have of getting home
@AmericanAir we're still here guys - you are the worst

@AmericanAir ok so why is it Late Flight? And for that matter why was my flight 4491 Cancelled Flighted this morning? I've been in YYZ since 5 AM.

@AmericanAir Kid upset, my staff upset (one accused of stealing fruit!!!!!) mistreatment due to airline policy of an Austic child.
@AmericanAir I have been trying to get through to someone about my Cancelled Flightled flight tomorrow for over 4 hours.
@AmericanAir flight from JFK to EGE was cxld after on runway for an hour. Flight moved to 7am but they won't give luggage back. Nice.
@AmericanAir delayed for two hours at ORD--&gt;CDG the one time I need to be there to catch a train... 
@AmericanAir not to mention its a three hour wait to get an agent on the phone.
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flighted our flight and now are still delayed...NOT COOL.
@AmericanAir we did for the last 8 hours.  Your customer service is horrendous.  I should have flown Delta
@AmericanAir there is a full flight of customers sitting on the plane waiting for baggage to be loaded on AA 356 in DFW - why? 2 hour delay
@AmericanAir why a different airport! I have no way of getting to a different airport.
@AmericanAir AA agent said I repeated myself when I was explaining. I told him ""I understand English."" His reply?""Our conversation is over.""
@AmericanAir long wait? I literally went shopping at 3 different centers, had lunch and prepared dinner. surprise, it's winter! staff better
@AmericanAir AA 1657 was also over an hour Late Flight to depart Ohare and now we have no luggage. Not happy standing in a long line at baggage svc
@AmericanAir Stuck on the plane in Charlotte.  Going to miss my connection.  No words from staff. Maybe some damn pretzels?
@AmericanAir - AA1344 Cancelled Flighted on 2.23 - rebooked on us air 623/544 on 2.24. Has to be a nonstop on 2.24 for us (2)?
@AmericanAir today's wait was a violation of #dot #passengerbillofrights http://t.co/GxvFumn3iZ
@AmericanAir arrived in lax from ord flight AA1657 NO LUGGAGE
@AmericanAir I've got a BA flight as your airport couldn't accommodate us. We were left without any info. No vouchers for food,nothing.
@AmericanAir flight 1019 I need 2 b on the first flight out frm MIA 2 TPA. I'm extremely irritated. I've been at this airport for 5.5 hrs.
@AmericanAir flight 3056 in D/FW now delayed 2 hours waiting sitting in plane for baggage to be loaded - why?
@AmericanAir … Been trying to book a whole new flight since 2 hours!! what is wrong with your website?
@AmericanAir Now your site is not working! WTF
@AmericanAir @Delta @JetBlue can you help? @SpiritAirlines is in the wrong, stuck in Florida 3days. They need to learn from real airlines.
@AmericanAir it wasn't ' disrupted' it was Cancelled Flightled. Airport agents were horrendous. Sharon was your saviour
@AmericanAir my flight has been delayed &amp; I can't talk reach anyone in customer service because of high call volume.
@AmericanAir why does your RTW planner (spec. Circle Pacific) not let me even plan the demo routes from your website?
@AmericanAir @Delta @JetBlue I am going to be stuck in Florida for 3 days because @SpiritAirlines wouldn't hold my connecting flight to LGA
@AmericanAir I even went to ticket counter and got no help
@AmericanAir Just learned my flight is Cancelled Flightled.can't get through by phone and don't see any option for assistance online. Any suggestions?
@AmericanAir Got an email about an itinerary change, but can't seem to get to anyone on phone. New flight time doesn't work for me. Help?
@AmericanAir 's computer systems are down, can't leave without a flight plan! Any ETA, American air?
.@AmericanAir ReFlight Booking Problems for the following day is unacceptable. DMing you that and our phone number.
@AmericanAir I want the flight I have on hold. I don't want a new flight.
@AmericanAir Sitting at the gate on Flight 719 for an hour due to Sabre being down. What backup plan is in place if Sabre cannot be fixed?
@AmericanAir please pray for us that our gear is not lost or stolen due to YOUR incompetent employees. #CNN #ABCNews #MSNBC #Photography
@AmericanAir ...is this how you want to treat your platinum (and two gold) flyers??
@AmericanAir Your gate attendants in ABQ are awful as was your service. You should be ashamed. Terrible experience here from start to finish
@AmericanAir Still sitting in airport as 6:05 flt delayed until 6:55...but still not boarding, what is happening?  No info....
@AmericanAir @sa_craig no gate agent, and only 3 PA updates for 3 hours, hinted at abandonment. horrible experience for all passengers.
@AmericanAir been a very long day in Philly...12:13pm flt to ORD Cancelled Flighted with NO notice, no message, no email.  NOT NICE FOR WE PLATINUMS.
@AmericanAir my travel for tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled and then stupidly rebooked for tomorrow! I can't get through to reservations!
@AmericanAir 1416 Cancelled Flightled? Can't get out for two days? No explanation?
@AmericanAir @sa_craig no, not helped one bit. actually ended up driving home due to extreme disorganization and lack of communication.
@AmericanAir United needs our ticket number since you rebooked us and you gave the incorrect ticket number now we can't check in #help
@AmericanAir I've been trying to call to cxl a reservation for tomorrow, due to needing surgery this week - cannot get through?
@AmericanAir I can't keep dialing you guys all day. Can I get into the callback queue?
@AmericanAir I've called that and they said they can't help me and it's out of their hands. I really feel like an under appreciated customer
@AmericanAir they could be seen if your horrible customer service group would actually update the information! Never fly American again!
@AmericanAir Stuck on a plane at JFK: food was not on the plane now we need to wait crew to push back the plane. Good job, AA!
@AmericanAir while I'm aggravated - shouldn't baggage fees disappear now that gas prices have dropped?
@americanair never fails to disappoint. waiting at jfk an hour after scheduled take off and still no word on departure
@AmericanAir one of my luggage didn't made it onto my flight, hope it really gets here tomorrow, as I was told 
@AmericanAir lost my wife's luggage and nobody gives you and answer, all they say is go here or call there.
@AmericanAir why don't you have driver service to get employees to work in bad weather like hospitals etc #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir the fact that that rule makes it poor customer service. I can Cancelled Flight/change on @SouthwestAir with no penalty or hoops.
@AmericanAir a phone call or email when you Cancelled Flight a flight would be lovely.
@AmericanAir You've now put me on a BA flight - can I get access for 2 for the lounge? Been at ORD for 11.5 hrs now and still have 5 to go.
@AmericanAir flight 1081 from IAD to LAX sat for more than 3hrs because ground crew couldn't drive in snow #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir you cxl both my flights to/from DFW to CLL w/o notice then treat me like trash on the phone and offer no compensation? WTH?
As am I, @AmericanAir - but thankfully there was a @united lounge next door. Really not impressed by oneworld partnerships :(
@AmericanAir delayed.....wow
@AmericanAir My flt AA375 for 02/23 got cncled and i cant get hold of a CSR so i can get alternate arrangement. Plz help
@AmericanAir our flight was Cancelled Flightled and rebooked to United. You didn't give them accurate ticket number now we can't check in. #annoyed
@AmericanAir You guys are totally losing me. I've been an AA fan for years but telling me reps are busy and hanging up on me is really bad.
@AmericanAir @NY_NJairports AA1224: 45 mins for Priority bags to arrive, now Late Flight for evening plans! Delta 20 min bag guarantee anyone? :(
@AmericanAir sitting in a 2 hour long at least phone queue. Hoping I get things rebooked in time or at least some plastic wings. #tears
@AmericanAir is rude a hiring requirement at key west airport shaking my head
@AmericanAir 11 out of 11 delayed flights, you suck and getting worse
@AmericanAir Tired of sitting on a delayed #1702 again and again computer down
@AmericanAir @dotnetnate Two hour wait for EXPs as I sit on a JFK PHX flight because US computers are down. Any shot at an LAX flight?
@AmericanAir @SeguineJ AA - this is a joke, right? That line isn't even accepting calls right now - they just hang up.
@AmericanAir yes, and rebooked incorrectly.
@AmericanAir fair enough. But they could have at least told us. Once again it's the lack of communication. Delays happen, just tell me
@AmericanAir even with calls you haven't been able to help us anyway. #nevergettinghome
@AmericanAir 2293 is the Cancelled Flightled one
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled my flight, didn't notify me, and I can only rebook by phone, but can't get through to an agent. Epic. Fail.
@AmericanAir i was just severely upset by the rude cs rep. I get she's prob stressed, but I am too! An ""aw, let me help"" cld mk it btr
@AmericanAir while I'm sensitive to this fact, I don't believe that warrants poor service. A little help &amp; compassion goes a long way.
@AmericanAir I did. 5 times. With 4 of those being hung up on. The other one it finally sent me to the call back notification. #FixYourStuff
@AmericanAir complt incompetence on flt 295.Lav delay from a pln that lnded last nite, no internet and poor svc. Not what I expect from u.
@AmericanAir why would I bother wasting my time calling them when they are gunna do nothing
@AmericanAir five times at last count
@AmericanAir as usual my next flight shows on time but it's suppose to leave in 5 minutes and hasn't boarded
@AmericanAir this might look good but the pita is inedible. Last year delicious shrimp cocktail. This year garbage http://t.co/Sotl8XQsrp
@AmericanAir that's if it is ever complete and if i can ever get through customer service #theydontanswer
@AmericanAir Where are your tickets offices in Boston? Impossible to book by phone or use vouchers on website, what a headache. PLEASE HELP!
@AmericanAir not sure what this means but son and I will certainly have operational needs for seats during Flt. 1679 next Friday, yet...
@AmericanAir @SentieriMelinda Any updates? It shouldn't take hours for assistance. I love @SouthwestAir
@AmericanAir I've flown you many years without a complaint. You should start listening to your customers.  You went from first to worst
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled 2 of my flights for maintenance. Customer service desk is empty... Can I get a hotel at least? http://t.co/ypbkCiRBXu
@AmericanAir served me rubber pasta covered In sauce that tastes like plastic. Do you have any food for human consumption anymore ?
@AmericanAir why do #exp members have to wait ""over 2 hours"" to speak with an operator? Surely this is a mistake?
@AmericanAir u Cancelled Flightled my flight for tomorrow and tell me to call reservations but then refuse to take my call!!!  #not cool #hateful
@AmericanAir u cant spell airline and I trusted you to get me home on time and safe you are the worst #gobankrupt http://t.co/aM9CuieWO4
@AmericanAir Where are your ticket offices in Boston? Impossible to book by phone or use voucher on website, what a headache! PLEASE HELP!
@AmericanAir I changed my own flight to tonight. Why couldn't AA do that on my behalf instead of a flight tomorrow? Poor effort all around.
@AmericanAir she should not only get a refund but also an apology for the deplorable service.
@AmericanAir third you lost her bag &amp; after 50 mins of being on hold you told her she would ""eventually get her bag"" completely unacceptable
@AmericanAir second, she sat on the Tarmac for 3 hrs only to be told it would be 30 mins
@AmericanAir there's a direct from Miami w a seat but u rebooked niece Tuesday. Can't get through on phones? #customerservicefail
@AmericanAir you have such a confusing web site/complicated ordering process. This is why I typically fly @SouthwestAir.
@AmericanAir first my sister had ZERO food in her cross country flight with no type of warning or voucher
@AmericanAir rented van drove 250 miles with 6 strangers.  Arrived home 6:00am. No offers of help from AA. http://t.co/BTTGmyN0A0
@AmericanAir the ticket is a poor gesture of goodwill (for missed trip) to a top status flyer - I may not next time (AA91 LHR-ORD 2/16)
@AmericanAir @NY_NJairports Do you guys teach poor customer service or is it just part of an american dream?
@AmericanAir 3231DTW to LAG at 4:45. Flight Cancelled Flightled with no notice. Given a voucher to a dirty hotel, with no food vouchers or apology.
No one answers phone, delayed/Cancelled Flightled flights. Rude employees. You only get (I'm sorry, we apologize) blah blah blah. Bad
@AmericanAir Reservation Line won't let me speak to a representative because they are too busy. They literally disconnect you. Why bother?
@AmericanAir Im trying to call and book a reward ticket on one world partners but your automated system wont let me talk to any1.  Great job

@AmericanAir you suck worst airline ever I will never be flying you again I have been stuck here for 13 hours no one is helping #fuckoff
@AmericanAir I have been on hold 3 hours.  2 seconds of it with a rude agent.
@AmericanAir  Dear American, when did 2 hour hold times become the industry standard?  Have you heard of additional staffing during weather?
@AmericanAir that's unacceptable. They should allow me to wait on hold, or take my number and call me themselves.
@AmericanAir I let a crew member know every time this happens.  Which is most of the time.
@AmericanAir are you kidding me?  No one answering calls on reserv line due to high call volume and not even an option to wait.  Brutal
@AmericanAir man we have been sitting in #UA4753 on the tarmac for 30 mins...rescue us please!
@AmericanAir please fix your inventory system, Plat upgraded then bumped DOWN after boarding, FA said they made a mistake. AA45 3A➡️8C 

@AmericanAir Still waiting on bags from flight 1613/2440 yesterday  First Class passenger not happy with your service.
@AmericanAir understand waiting 2+ hours for callback on the exec plat line but when call dropped the agent could at least try again

@AmericanAir that's not what I asked :)) I'm looking to change a Flight Booking Problems for 03.03. Can you help
@AmericanAir your service is horrible. I can't get a straight answer from your ground agents.
@AmericanAir Yes. Your service in GUC sucks. Your gate agent pushed a passenger and has been rude to everyone since we got here.
@AmericanAir After 3 days NO BAGs amazing the way that you neglect customers
@AmericanAir Worst airline ever. We have been stranded for 24 hours because of your 7 hour delay with flight 104 last night.

@AmericanAir 1st leg of my flight 2 nyc tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled. if you make me hold for 2hrs i may miss my only chance back home!
@AmericanAir there was also not one single person at the counter answering questions for our plane full of confused people. No staff at all.
@AmericanAir That's a complete cop out! U ask what the issues are, then do nothing about it. How are we supposed to sort the situation now?
@AmericanAir fcuk you. Shit service. You got no fans.
@AmericanAir not only did you rebook me on the wrong day, your phone system says it can't handle the volume and hangs up on me!!!
@AmericanAir how did my prime, ticketed seat get switched on AA 343?! Not sure what's going on here...

@AmericanAir My flights tomorrow were Cancelled Flighted, can't do anything online, and can't get through on phone. Help?

@AmericanAir I get &amp; can appreciate that. I've just had so many problems in the last year flying with guys... Pretty aggravating.
@AmericanAir not sure why I would bother when the agent at the airport didnt help &amp; nobody on phone would. Ticket Cancelled Flightled for no reason.
@AmericanAir HELP NEEDED ! #complaint ticketed passenger with no available seats scheduled to leave Late Flightr today
@AmericanAir leave our luggage in the baggage claim without any previous information! That's not the deal!! http://t.co/oTTy5rYMzD
@AmericanAir Somehow between DFW and MIA I got bumped from 12B all the way to 41G on 2312? What's up with that?
@AmericanAir #AmericanAirlines 1 1/2 hr wait for bags. If this is the a taste of the worlds largest airline, heaven help aviation
@AmericanAir @macario2 but you are Late Flight again!! Again and again! Where are the crew?
@AmericanAir that's quite an impressive list of fees!
@AmericanAir @GolfWithWoody Don't buy it, Woody. They're making it MUCH worse with understaffing, rudeness, and pre-rookie mistakes
@AmericanAir you have to run the engine to troubleshoot an issue before boarding the plane!?! How about another plane? #aa2227 #miatoiah
@AmericanAir flight was Cancelled Flightled can you guys help?
@AmericanAir Changed flight from BNA to 2/20 ahead of weather. Slammed me with cost diff because ""no weather advisory.""Really!
@AmericanAir my itinerary was from EWR TO DALLAS to LA. You Cancelled Flightled my flight, you have my money, find a way to get me there from EWR
@AmericanAir an hour at baggage carousel and still no luggage?? Nail in the coffin.
@AmericanAir Can't get thru by phone to use a credit that's about to expire! #frustrated #aa.com
@AmericanAir now down to only one agent helping a stagnant line of almost 100 customers. Super.
@AmericanAir The bad weather wasn't a surprise! You should have double/triple staff on hand to handle calls. Way to treat your customers.
@AmericanAir flight Cancelled Flighted out of LAX for tomorrow due to connection in DFW. Help please? we can go out of orange or burbank
@AmericanAir first the pilot, then the catering...
@AmericanAir I would like a refund for this flight. They delayed the flight 5 times. I feel like you're making fun of us.
@AmericanAir @TheNateK I submitted a complaint via that link in Dec. &amp; followed up in Jan. NEVER HEARD BACK! #badcustomerservice
@AmericanAir flights been Cancelled Flightled, can't get through to the desk and nothing showing online under my reservation - what do I do?
@AmericanAir The point of the pic: If your reps struggle with the merger this much, imagine how it is for the public! http://t.co/hQdB5IRuVg
@AmericanAir I was flying from Ft Lauderdale FL to Seattle WA on the 02/28/2015 until the 03/03/2015 and they don't want to honor my flight.
@AmericanAir wasn't able to get on hold. Your system kept kicking me to the main menu.
@americanair Seattle check-in. 1 desk servicing full service line. 2 desks servicing priority. Full srvc wait 30+ minutes. Customer svc fail
@AmericanAir hey! Tried calling customer service and was told there's a 2 hour wait. This has been for the past 4 hours. Thanks! You suck!
@AmericanAir but have been yet to receive assistance from one of your agents in securing a new connection. Many will now miss work tomorrow.
@AmericanAir @naomi_cooper Are you out of your mind, AA? What is the point of this Twitter acct? Form letters in 140 characters or less?
@AmericanAir  many have missed connections already b/c of delayed flight which will finally board soon
@AmericanAir I wasn't important this morning when you would not seat my wife and I together or allow me to choose seats at Flight Booking Problems!!
@AmericanAir i dont believe it, it has been impossible for your agents to get an update from the delivery company since yesterday at 11 am
@AmericanAir yet there are plenty of available AA agents at gates nearby who say they are unable to help customers from our flight.
@AmericanAir @BDinDallas The personal touch you're known for, AA. Other cool perks: blaming understaffing on weather. And 3 hr hold times.
@AmericanAir been waiting in line for over an hour in San Antonio, barely moved &amp; only two agents. 30 in front of me &amp; at least 40 behind.
@AmericanAir. You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket.  I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops.
@AmericanAir ....I am on attempt #6 and hour #10 of calling and being put on hold.  Not feeling confident that I will ever get through...
@AmericanAir bought a ticket on @SouthwestAir. After two days, your ""team"" couldn't share the data needed to get me to my next meeting.
@AmericanAir thanks for the response. I know it's not your fault... But Im in ORD in T5 and hungry if you want to stop by ✈️✌️
@AmericanAir nah u boofin u dont talk like any humans i know. Respond like u actually have a brain. And again i dont want customer relations
@AmericanAir I have no transportation to and going to some other city and getting to NY sometime on Wed?! I'm sorry that's not gonna cut
@AmericanAir because of you, I am doing the one thing I tried to avoid. Thank you for sending me to baggage claim.
@AmericanAir my flt is at 7a tom. I have now rec'd notification that I'm going out from some other airport
@AmericanAir can you help me with a reservation? cant get through on the phone
@AmericanAir ask the 10 people you left behind at Miami airport because you guys could not wait 5 minutes and ... http://t.co/XPM98Igqjn
@AmericanAir can you do anything to get #AA953 moving? Been almost 24 hrs and hundreds at jfk upset, tired and want to get to BA.
@AmericanAir more of the insane treatment by your customers
@AmericanAir @_emmaclifford No. At JFK you sort of have to guess things out. It's a small airport, so whatever.
@AmericanAir is this how you let your employees treat your loyal customers? #attackingbabymomma #crazinessintherockies
@AmericanAir @ejacqui If you updated the screens, then people would know the Late Flightst info, good or bad. And that wouldn't work because...
@AmericanAir missing a full days of work thanks guys
@AmericanAir Trying to find out if flight #340 DFW to HOU is on tonight. Exec platinum desk not calling back and online info not clear.
.@AmericanAir I can't even get on the phone with your reservations team. The system automatically disconnects us.
@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flighted and rebooked but agent made a mistake and booked wrong date! Been trying to get through via phone for hours!!
@AmericanAir @russelneiss No, American. This is simple. How about YOU call HER back with the info for her new flight. Basic customer service
@AmericanAir I have looked and I was told it was in Guatemala last night. No record of anywhere today. I need my clothing for work tomorrow.
@AmericanAir Cool, a canned response. Nah, I think I'll keep tweeting at everyone who mentions AA on Twitter. You could DM me, though.
@AmericanAir please fix your mobile and desktop site to allow Canadians to select a passenger when checking in. Thanks.
@AmericanAir tried ringing but told me to try again Late Flightr. I'm supposed to be leaving in an hour...
.@AmericanAir cover a rental car or refund our ticket? - I'll gladly drive 10 hrs home than be stuck here till Tues!
@AmericanAir should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket!
@AmericanAir   You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket.  I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops.
@AmericanAir @sweetmel If weather is bad, wouldn't your folks try extra hard to communicate...or load bags onto flight 1320...or...anything?
@AmericanAir and how is this not a mechanical issue? All evidence points to the idea that it’s the ILS at CLL at fault, not the weather.
@AmericanAir @CAexhibitions Sorry in, like, a general way? Or sorry that incompetence/understaffing is compounding weather issues?
@AmericanAir @tennetexan Too bad there's only, like, 3 people on that team, then. Because this is next level unreal.
@AmericanAir @marxsterbcow How is this a real life response to a customer service issue? Seriously. Keep trying to call us. Eh, might work.
@AmericanAir fix the engine of flight AA3031so I don't spend all night in your airport so I can fly home tomorrow
@AmericanAir @ActingOutMgmnt Just make sure they remember to load the bags onto the plane. They Cancelled Flight the flight when they forget...
@AmericanAir @brewcrewfan8 Is this real life, AA? Like, 2015 real life? You should be emailing/calling/DMing people you've inconvenienced.
@AmericanAir weather is unavoidable. Understaffing is controllable
@AmericanAir Not only was 5418 Late Flight, but we've been boarded and waiting for over 30min. WTF?
@AmericanAir I know.  After an hour I got a live person.  It messes up our arrival and car plans at two airports and is costing us more.
@AmericanAir i was also told by agents my issues ""aren't their prob"" K fine. I get it. But have some compassion 4 others dealing w/this!!!
@AmericanAir What's the status at DFW? Ticket agent at gate A9 was very rude and unhelpful.
@AmericanAir i was spoken 2 like I'm an idiot and that is not OK!! I don't need to deal w/ that esp after the travel experience I've had
@AmericanAir I really hope it departs. They said is because the catering service wasnt available but we can see it next to plane doing nthin
@AmericanAir I understand weather is not your fault but ur cs reps are atrocious. I am NOT happy nor will I EVR fly w/ u again.
@AmericanAir When I left Orlando, I was 2nd in line for standby. I land and I'm 4th. 'Priority members get first available seats'. Awesome.
@AmericanAir You didn't respond to my DM. You tweeted the same canned tweet you're telling everyone else.
@AmericanAir I DMed you my AA &amp; phone #s &amp; you can't have someone call me? What was the point of your response? You didn't resolve anything!
@AmericanAir don't you guys have an email address? Just put me on the next available flight from ohare
@AmericanAir But Eagle is always Late Flight
@AmericanAir your call center won't let me wait on hold, which I would happily do. Am I seriously supposed to just keep calling? Not great
@AmericanAir half hour Late Flight leaving DFW...no attempt at an explanation
@AmericanAir 30 minutes flight from OKC and then make us wait, 30 minutes cause the gate isn't empty.  #epicfail #poorplanning
@AmericanAir seems like queue times are very high, in Q waiting for an agent 4 almost  an hour.Flight got Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/sDm2wvR3zr
@AmericanAir Nah, just horrible dining options outside of club. Luckily Manuel in the Admirals can make a Bloody Mary.
@AmericanAir no hold times, just disconnections.   There is no excuse for that
.@AmericanAir nice 2 know. I paid 4 a seat. Then you sold my seat. now I bought a 3rd seat. It's a good scam, but a scam all the same.
@AmericanAir I've been trying for 4 hours to get hold of someone.
@AmericanAir  beyond frustrated with no call back from auto hold or whatever you call it. Entered my number at 11:30 CST, still no call 2:26
@AmericanAir ahhhh your silence is golden now.  This tops it all.  Anyone get fired?
@AmericanAir we've been on hold for hours.
@AmericanAir @Stone9956 Do you dislike delays when they're caused by YOUR crew forgetting to load bags &amp; lazy pilot wanting duty day to end?
@AmericanAir @travisamex It's not the weather. It's also gross incompetence. Understaffing. Crew forgetting to load bags. Don't duck truth.
@AmericanAir .....and they waited 5 hours in a stuffy plane until they could get off then 7 more hrs to get their luggage  #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir trying to book a flight on hold- can't get through to a representative on the phone- Advice?
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flights flights arbitrarily on same itinerary.  Weekend ruined for no good reason! No crew = missed Monday am mtg.
@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled from Laguardia to Louisville Ky and i am  stuck at the airport. Do you guys compensate for this?
@AmericanAir &amp; if that wasn't enough, your staff have been so rude &amp; ignored passengers,don't think that should be accepted whatever reason
@AmericanAir I understand the weather issue but you can't expect passengers to wait 24 hours inside airports for whatever reason. Outrageous
@AmericanAir a friend is having flight Cancelled Flightlations out of LAX to CMH on Feb 23. Anyway to help her? 800 number has been no help
@AmericanAir I used the ""call back"" feature with an operator regarding my flight, got a call 2 hours Late Flightr and got hung up on. #pleasehelp
@AmericanAir I need to be at work tomorrow at 8am, therefore that doesn't help.  Direct message faster than calling 800 number? #Backwards
@AmericanAir  ugh Dump us in dfw w/no luggage then Cancelled Flight our flight 3 more times. Sat arrival now Tue?
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flights my flight, doesn't send an email, text or call. Then puts me on way earlier flight I might miss now. Thanks AA!
@AmericanAir 3078 is overweight so you pull 2 dozen passengers off? Why not luggage? Seriously?
@AmericanAir I wait 2+ hrs for CS to call me back re why  flt is cxld/protection &amp; they hang up the minute I answer on 1st ring?
@AmericanAir I've been on hold for 55 mins about my Cancelled Flighted international flight. Am out of country, so can't leave a call back #. Help?
I just need a place to sleep when I land without accommodations in PLS @AmericanAir!
@AmericanAir Call me Chairman, or call me Emerald. After what you did today to me, you can call me a former customer.
@AmericanAir Flight 953 NYC-Buenos Aires has been delay since yesterday at 10PM. Is going to take off at 3.30PM now? Give us answers!
@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, can't go home until tomorrow. I could use dinner and a play, @AmericanAir! It's my first time in NYC.
@AmericanAir How do I change my flight if the phone system keeps telling me that the representatives are busy?
@AmericanAir thx for nothing on getting us out of the country and back to US. Broken plane? Come on. Get another one.
@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled, leaving tomorrow morning. Auto rebooked for a Tuesday night flight but need to arrive Monday.
@AmericanAir leaving over 20 minutes Late Flight. No warnings or communication until we were 15 minutes Late Flight. That's called shitty customer svc

Ok, @apple. You win. I won't use your browser anymore since it keeps closing on me. Literally 8 times today. I counted.

#Coachella2015 line up is just meh...not that excited to go, but since I already bought the ticket, I guess I will
#Coachella2015 line up is weak , a couple good acts here and there butttt for the most part wack ! Pass.
#Coachella2015 line up less than impressive, but still stoked for dartying in the sun to Alesso

@thekevinryder I really hope they add ""The Master Baiters"" to #Coachella2015
@VitaliyP Very recycled lineup this year, though. Many of the same bands that have played the big three the last two years. #Coachella2015
A band that shouldn't be alive, a guy who looks dead and...eyebrows that started from the bottom and never stopped. #Coachella2015
A better line up last year...#Coachella2015 #Outkast babe
ACDC, bad religion, and jack white at #Coachella2015 ... Is this KROQ's weenie roast circa 2000? No thank you.
All these complaints over Steely Dan playing Coachella, you’d think organizers would go back… Jack… and do it again.  #Coachella2015

Can't even secure a ticket for weekend 2 #Coachella2015  :( So frustrating...

Coachella sucks. I can see Drake and AC/DC anytime they tour. Yawn  #Coachella #Coachella2015
Coachella, fuuuuuuuuck. #Coachella #coachellalineup #Coachella2015

Dear #Coachella, find better headliners please. #Coachella2015 #coachellalineup
Dear Coachella, either I'm too old or your lineup is LAME! Try again please.   #Coachella2015
Dear Coachella, I just a heart attack purchasing tickets. #Coachella2015 #shitmypants
Everyone is freaking out about the #Coachella2015 line up, but I'm over here drooling over the #Ultra2015 line up 
Final decision: to not Coahella, had my head dress and everything #Coachella2015
For once, I'll actually be doing something cooler than going to #Coachella2015 this year 

FUCK YOU!!! ""@ChrisMuhdeena: so I heard #Coachella2015 line-up will be full of overrated artists this year.... say it ain't so!""
Go home #Coachella2015 lineup, you're drunk.
Going to #Coachella2015 now is like Christmas shopping on black friday in the desert...2 crowded, 100 degrees, high ass people, over priced
Honestly don't know what to think about Steely Dan playing #Coachella2015 . Like, just sitting at my desk shaking my head.
How the fuck do you even say this one's? Axwell up to the power of Ingrosso? I want rock, not math!  #Coachella2015

I'm glad to see DJ Snake, but his brother usually always mess up his shows with his Metal Gear #Coachella2015
If I wanted to hear AC DC and a whole lot of metallic noise I'd go to Jiffy Lube and save a few thousand dollars #Coachella2015
If popularity is a sword, then #Coachella2015 seems to have committed seppuku with it. #sameoldbands #newhigherprices #RIP
Just saying, coachella isn't that crash hot this year #Coachella2015
Lame #Coachella2015 lineup(except for #jackwhite and #steelydan,of course).Looks like it's #Stagecoach for us this year! #yeehaw #desertlife
Looking at the #Coachella2015 line up like... ""who are these people!?""
Man, is this poster for ants or something? #Coachella2015
My phone sucks for examining the #Coachella2015 poster - So Jack White is on, but not The Dead Weather? How 'bout Eagles of Death Metal?
No 1D, 5SOS or Big Time Rush at #Coachella2015 ? Such bullshit, this year is going to be terrible
No Paul McCartney at #Coachella because this is for BIG NAMES ONLY, right Kanye fans? #Coachella2015
Nobody I really planned to see, ever. #Coachella2015
Not a ton of excitement about the #Coachella2015 lineup, but happy to see Desaparecidos, Belle &amp; Sebastian and Ratatat in there.
Not even when The cure or Suede played, did I want to go. #Coachella2015  I went to the very first one &amp; that was enough. Over it. 
Not gonna lie, #coachella2015 and #govball2015 lineups have been underwhelming so far... maybe #firefly2015 will be better
Not gonna lie, I'm a little disappointed @RaeSremmurd isn't on the #Coachella2015 Lineup #IAintGotNoType
Not impressed by #Coachella2015's lineup at all. Maybe once I live in Cali, I'll feel differently. But for now, I'm just like, eh.
Not overly stoked on the lineup, but it could be worse. #Coachella2015

Someone purchase my #Coachella2015 tickets, I don't have time to wait for this shit
St. Vincent, St. Paul and the broken bones, St. Lucia... Since when #Coachella2015 is a Christian rock festival?
That awkward moment when the #GovBall2015 lineup is better than the #Coachella2015 lineup.  New York - 1 California - 0
That Coachella line up looks softer than a Drake somber track....oh wait, what? #Coachella2015
That coachella list tho. Man AC/DC, Jack White, and Drake? Man it's like a time line of how mainstream is changing! #Coachella2015

I left my pocket guide at the hotel. I don't know how I'm going to cope. What does that say about the usability of iPad/iPhone app? #SXSW
I meant I also wish I  at #SXSW #dyac stupid iPhone!
I need to find a better #SXSW stream to follow. The inane iPad 2 tweets are surely not what SouthBy is about
I never realized how shitty by iphone battery was until #sxsw I'm charging every few hours
I think #Google lost their way by caring too much about their business (instead of their users) Tim O'Reilly #sxsw #pnid
I think #SXSW has taken it upon itself to make it clear to me that a Gen 1 iPhone ain't gonna cut it anymore.
I think my effing hubby is in line for an #iPad 2. Can someone point him towards the line-up for wife number #2. #sxswi #sxsw
I was going to mock the tech-nerds for coming to #sxsw only to stand in a 4-hour line for an iPad 2. Then I remembered me and horror movies.
I'm pretty sure the panelist that thinks &quot;Apple is drowning in their success&quot; is fucking insane. #SXSW
I'm thinking that I may actually have to take my laptop to #sxsw. The iPad alone may not be enough on this trip.

@andyfatbastard theyâ€™re doing a good job of not implying the autonomous, sentient car that was involved in the accident is not at fault.
@Asher_Wolf driverless cars are the libertarian answer to transit, PRT, nonsense. Doesnâ€™t solve gridlock/peak use problem. We need trains.
@AtlanticCities   sure glad I'm not on the road (living in Manhattan) - the land of buses &amp; subways.  I'll worry when we have driverless MTA
@avphotographic watched a segment on it once.  I just don't trust 'self-driving' cars, but yet I ride our driverless rapid transit here.
@bradtem: it's odd that people are will be more scared of driverless cars than drunk drivers  - people don't like being killed by robots
@BrianSaysStuff: California apparently passed a bunch of ""self-driving car laws"". First law; Kill all humans.
@connellmcshane you have been doing great...very funny just watching dvr...i wouldnt get in a driverless car either...great job
@elenaneira The horrible way a self-driving car might go awry, or if your Nest turns off heat in subzero weather? That's just the beginning

@RichRuh itâ€™s all worth it to free up more engineers to work on ridiculous glasses and self-driving cars that, while cool, no one will buy.
